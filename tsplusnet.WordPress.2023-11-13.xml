		<strong>
Over the years corporations have deployed a diverse mix of software and hardware applications to gain competitive advantage. Rapid advancements in IT, combined with evolving business needs, have resulted in contrasting IT environments across enterprises.</strong> <h2></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">At one end of the spectrum are open architecture applications that leverage on the potential of the of Internet, while the other end comprises traditional, close-ended, legacy software. It is more common than expected for corporate data to reside on legacy software. Hence, to meet tomorrow’s business needs, successful management and re-deployment of legacy systems is a major challenge today.</p>
<h2>What are Legacy Applications?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Typically, a legacy system consists of large applications that access voluminous data stored in legacy database management systems running on mainframes or mid-range platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These systems made economic sense when they were developed and installed. However, as technological update frequencies multiplied and business needs evolved, they have become complex and uneconomical to maintain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As enterprises have invested considerable amounts of time and money in these systems, how could these investments be written off?</p>
<h2>What are the Problems with legacy Applications?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In their current state, most legacy applications have several challenges associated with their functioning and maintenance. Here are some typical challenges.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Legacy systems were often built for internal, enterprise-wide usage, while today’s business demands that they be exposed to external entities such as the Internet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Such applications are inflexible and not modular. Their use consumes critical resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Lack of documentation and skilled manpower make any modification complicated and can lead to crashes and breakdowns in unpredictable parts of the system.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Legacy Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Organizations continue to use legacy applications for various reasons such as:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Legacy systems were developed for, and still run, mission-critical applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. A large number of users utilize the system. They are very familiar with the functionalities of the applications, including look and feel. They have also gained a complete understanding of the strengths and limitations of the system.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. The underlying hardware and software of such legacy systems is time-tested and very reliable. The applications themselves have evolved over a few decades and behave very predictably.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These factors contribute to the continued usage of legacy systems. Now, effective modernization of these legacy systems will ensure that these benefits can be amplified at minimal expense. </p>
<h2>Technological Progress meets IT cuts and Internet based Work-Mobility</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Efforts to address the challenges of modern use of legacy applications have been piecemeal and of limited impact. The combination of new systems and retrofitted older ones have compounded the problem. Adoption of new technology and languages has often been only for technology’s sake. Finally, the need to deliver application functionality via new channels like mobile devices, with differing transaction approaches add to the problems of successful legacy modernization.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">More problems come with the disappearance of in-house IT teams and IT budget cuts, as well as the need for a mobile office on smaller devices or from outside company walls. With such small means and aims that have rocketed, the need for a solution has become urgent for many businesses.</p>
<h2>Publishing Applications to the Web to Leverage their Value</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the investments in finances, time and infrastructure are taken into account, no wonder companies are reluctant to part with stable, time-proven applications which do what they need and which their users know well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The issue is that when evolving beyond legacy systems, business leaders must consider strategic issues such as, in no particular order:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Tightening IT budgets</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Total Cost of Ownership</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Productivity</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Flexibility</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Knowledge availability</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Extinct vendors</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Alignment with business goals</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. Administrator, IT team and User learning curves</p>
<h2>Web-Enabling Legacy Applications to Remotely Access them</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Various options are available involving migrating from Legacy systems to more contemporary platforms (Functional Extension, Technical Extension, Migration, Replacement). There is also the solution of Application Publishing. TSplus believe web-enabling your existing applications to be the simplest and most cost-efficient and time-effective way to step into a new era, all the while keeping your corporate applications and data safe behind your company firewall.</p>
<h2>Remote Access as a Bridge for Legacy and Latest Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>An enormous advantage brought by this solution is that you get the best of both worlds. Since users access company applications and data remotely, none of that is compromised outside the firewall, which is ideal. And since any applications can be access remotely from the point when you chose to publish them and make them accessible, then you and your teams or clients can use legacy or the latest applications side-by-side without even making the difference.</strong></p>
<h2></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>With TSplus Remote Access, you will discover a user-friendly tool to publish your legacy applications to the web and make them accessible for use by your staff or clients in only a few clicks. For that, visit our <a href="https://tsplus.net/download/">TSplus Remote Access</a> product page.</b></p>

Remote access programs are useful and efficient in a great many ways. The main focus of this technology is basically to make the office accessible from anywhere that has an internet connection. <strong>Our tools to illustrate this are <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a>, which enables application publication and makes your apps accessible from pretty much any device, and <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-work/">TSplus Remote Work</a>, which offers employees a take-away office workstation, in all simplicity. And in a different field, there is <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a>, which enables screen control and much more.
</strong><h2>Remote Software Uses</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">These days the line between work and home are blurring. While some employees finish their work at home and end up working longer hours than ever per week, others simply work remotely for organizational reasons. This is where remote software comes in. It allows employees to work as though they were in the office, from wherever they are.</p>
<h2>Remotely Access Desktops and Files from Anywhere</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may want to transfer files between your laptop and office PC. You might need to access a file left behind on your desktop computer. You could be on call and need to refer to documents in your office IT system. Or perhaps you need to access company resources and applications on a local area network or elsewhere. Remote access programs are the solution to your queries and problems.</p>
<h2>Remote Access for Employees, Administrators and Support Staff On-the-Go!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote access programs, from application publishing software to file transfer utilities, remote servers to remote-control software, are specially designed for those people who need remote access to the office network and resources or to specific machines.</p>
<h2>Remote Access to Local, Distant and Cloud Data</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">File-transfer utilities are inexpensive, easy-to-use packages that allow local or remote users to move even the largest files directly to and from any PC's hard drive or other devices as long as they are connected via Internet or networked via a cable or Wi-Fi. There is also the option of keeping everything out in the Cloud. This does away with the need to transfer anything since it is available from any device with a connection.</p>
<h2>Affordable and Scalable Remote Access Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some products are designed for small branch offices searching for an affordable, simple remote access solution. For larger companies, choices and bundles are available to scale up and extend the set-up according to the client’s specifications.</p>
<h2>Remote Control Software for your Support Team</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote-control software, such as GoToMyPC allows the user to control the computer that’s sitting in the office as if they were sitting in front of it. It opens up a browser window that displays the desktop screen of the host computer. The host computer may also hand over the control of the mouse and keyboard to the remote user for them to perform specific tasks. Handing off the controls will enable the remote user to manipulate the mouse and keyboard of the host computer as though they were their own.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This type of control saves your technicians the time and hassle of going to the remote user's location to make configuration changes. It also frees your support team to deal with issues on any device around the Globe. What’s more, they can even collaborate by inviting a colleague into the chat should the need arise. This may also be done for demonstration purposes if several people need to see a particular set of steps being carried out.</p>
<h2>Safe and Secure Remote Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whatever the task at hand, using remote software makes life a lot easier when outside the office. The main drawback of remote software is variety of potential security issues. Good remote software will allow full control to the authorized user but at the same time make sure un-authorized users do not have access. Our products are built with the safety and confidentiality of our users and their data in mind.</p>
<h2>Remote Software to Test or Buy Now</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With such a set of possibilities, businesses have some great tools at their fingertips, from enabling remote working to facilitating worldwide support, through web-enabling apps. <b>For further information on our remote software products, do discover our products for yourself on <a href="https://tsplus.net/">our website</a>.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>What is a Server?</h2>
<strong>
A server is a piece of equipment that allows you to run an application on a computer. What you are able to do depends on the type of server you are connected to.</strong> In fact, any computer can be designated as a server. A server is usually optimized for the user’s needs and provides access to multiple users at any one time.
The number of users will depend on the size and processing power of the server. <strong>Servers are used to offer remote access, database access and more generally to transfer files over a secure network.</strong>
<h2>Application Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Application Servers are computers that host applications for use and access from other computers. Generally designed to allow connections from multiple users simultaneously, app servers are often a benefit to businesses because it is more secure, cost effective and practical to have mission-critical applications installed in one place, than having them installed on multiple machines. This becomes especially important in a mobile workforce where business data is accessed by a wide array of devices that may not be directly under control of the business.</p>

<h2>Server Farms</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Server and server farms vary in size depending on the processing power needed and the amount of workload they are expected to handle during operational time. For example, a batch of server applications may be divided between a number of separate server computers in exceptional circumstances. However, in most cases, the server application can run on a single computer if the workload is light enough. With several applications, great numbers of users, or both, multiple servers are soon necessary. A group of servers working as one lot are called a farm of servers.</p>

<h2>Cyber-security, Servers and Risks</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most network designers will carry out a risk assessment of the servers and the information held on them, in order to limit damage that a server crash would cause. In order to do this, they would split up one server computer to handle one specific server application</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is also possible to use a server computer as a workstation computer. But, this may not be a company’s first choice due to the risks and damage that could be associated with this dual use, either on the grounds of security reasons and information safety purposes. Indeed, most servers tend to be shielded from the Internet while PCs are less far removed from the front line that is the Web.</p>

<h2>Internet as an Illustration of What a Server Farm is!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the best examples of how a farm of servers can work together is the Internet. The Internet is comprised of the client to server model where the Internet Service Providers direct the traffic across the biggest group of networked computers in the world. When thinking about servers and their role in daily life, it is useful to picture the Internet as it provides a clear picture of their use and function.</p>

<h2>Need to Monitor Your Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, if you are running more than one server, whether they form a network or not, you’ll need to monitor them somehow to overlook a whole panel of aspects of their usage and health. There is software available designed to perform that very task.</p>

<h2>What Server Monitoring Software is and does!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Server monitoring software enables IT technicians and administrators to perform a whole array of surveillance tasks. From controlling and monitoring the network traffic from a local area network and the internet, to seeing how much usage each server undergoes at any point in time, whether in terms of actual users or of overall workload, they can follow performances and use of individual servers and whole farms.</p>

<h2>How to Monitor Your Corporate Servers and Networks</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus has developed its own software, <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a>, with the these needs and more in mind. Network and server monitoring software is a diagnostic tool that monitors server and websites and displays network statistics in graphics or tables. You can use these statistics to collect information from the network's data stream. Such software will allow you to increase the reliability and productivity of your corporate servers and troubleshoot any hiccups before they become a problem for your users, clients or data.</p>

<h2>User-friendly and Comprehensive Server Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Server Monitoring is an easy-to-use surveillance console, device or browser-based. It can help you to track a variety of key points on your servers such as performance, process usage, bandwidth and users. The modern interface is web based and all you need is a device with a web browser to control TSplus Server Monitoring from the SSL/TLS protected web interface or over our HTML5 portal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It has a small software footprint and has an ergonomic and well-designed dashboard. The “home” display centralises your servers on one side and your websites on the other and you can navigate details of each of them via tabs as you would in a browser.</p>

<h2>Server Monitoring Features</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The basics are there, such as CPU and memory usage, disk read and write percentage statistics for each of your servers. You can follow in real time usage of each application, the bandwidth and users of each server. For websites you may track general site availability and look more specifically at response time at different point as well as having the visibility over average, minimum and maximum response times.</p>

<h2>Monitor Your Servers at Any Time and from Any Place</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A very important feature of our software is that you can tailor and get alerts. Beyond the comprehensive tables of alerts available in the Alerts tab of the TSplus Server Monitoring Dashboard, you can choose to receive email or Teams notifications whenever there is an alert, thus speeding up considerably response times when you are not in front of your screen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They will inform you when certain thresholds or criteria are reached. You can decide to be notified should any server memory fill to 90% or if they run on too great a percentage of their RAM capacity, or you could set different thresholds per server. You can receive emails for server downtime as well as concerning any website.</p>

<h2>Generate Reports</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can generate reports for your servers and websites, choose aspects according to your audience or needs and visually tailor them to your company colours. It is also possible for these reports to be automatically emailed according to filters you can create and amend.</p>

<h2>Easy-to-use Server Monitoring Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>In conclusion, TSplus Server Monitoring is a user-friendly and very efficient tool for monitoring server and websites wherever you are and whatever the time.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>From one server and website to server farms and multiple websites, our software, available for a <a href="https://tsplus.net/download/">free 15-day trial</a>, will be all set within a few clicks, to keep you on top of your monitoring tasks today.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

What you are able to do depends on the type of server you are connected to.<\/strong> In fact, any computer can be designated as a server. A server is usually optimized for the user\u2019s needs and provides access to multiple users at any one time.\nThe number of users will depend on the size and processing power of the server. <strong>Servers are used to offer remote access, database access and more generally to transfer files over a secure network.<\/strong>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>Application Servers<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Application Servers are computers that host applications for use and access from other computers. Generally designed to allow connections from multiple users simultaneously, app servers are often a benefit to businesses because it is more secure, cost effective and practical to have mission-critical applications installed in one place, than having them installed on multiple machines. This becomes especially important in a mobile workforce where business data is accessed by a wide array of devices that may not be directly under control of the business.<\/p>\n<h2>Server Farms<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Server and server farms vary in size depending on the processing power needed and the amount of workload they are expected to handle during operational time. For example, a batch of server applications may be divided between a number of separate server computers in exceptional circumstances. However, in most cases, the server application can run on a single computer if the workload is light enough. With several applications, great numbers of users, or both, multiple servers are soon necessary. A group of servers working as one lot are called a farm of servers.<\/p>\n<h2>Cyber-security, Servers and Risks<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most network designers will carry out a risk assessment of the servers and the information held on them, in order to limit damage that a server crash would cause. In order to do this, they would split up one server computer to handle one specific server application<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is also possible to use a server computer as a workstation computer. But, this may not be a company\u2019s first choice due to the risks and damage that could be associated with this dual use, either on the grounds of security reasons and information safety purposes. Indeed, most servers tend to be shielded from the Internet while PCs are less far removed from the front line that is the Web.<\/p>\n<h2>Internet as an Illustration of What a Server Farm is!<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the best examples of how a farm of servers can work together is the Internet. The Internet is comprised of the client to server model where the Internet Service Providers direct the traffic across the biggest group of networked computers in the world. When thinking about servers and their role in daily life, it is useful to picture the Internet as it provides a clear picture of their use and function.<\/p>\n<h2>Need to Monitor Your Servers<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now, if you are running more than one server, whether they form a network or not, you\u2019ll need to monitor them somehow to overlook a whole panel of aspects of their usage and health. There is software available designed to perform that very task.<\/p>\n<h2>What Server Monitoring Software is and does!<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Server monitoring software enables IT technicians and administrators to perform a whole array of surveillance tasks. From controlling and monitoring the network traffic from a local area network and the internet, to seeing how much usage each server undergoes at any point in time, whether in terms of actual users or of overall workload, they can follow performances and use of individual servers and whole farms.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Monitor Your Corporate Servers and Networks<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">TSplus has developed its own software, <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/server-monitoring\/\">TSplus Server Monitoring<\/a>, with the these needs and more in mind. Network and server monitoring software is a diagnostic tool that monitors server and websites and displays network statistics in graphics or tables. You can use these statistics to collect information from the network's data stream. Such software will allow you to increase the reliability and productivity of your corporate servers and troubleshoot any hiccups before they become a problem for your users, clients or data.<\/p>\n<h2>User-friendly and Comprehensive Server Monitoring<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">TSplus Server Monitoring is an easy-to-use surveillance console, device or browser-based. It can help you to track a variety of key points on your servers such as performance, process usage, bandwidth and users. The modern interface is web based and all you need is a device with a web browser to control TSplus Server Monitoring from the SSL\/TLS protected web interface or over our HTML5 portal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It has a small software footprint and has an ergonomic and well-designed dashboard. The \u201chome\u201d display centralises your servers on one side and your websites on the other and you can navigate details of each of them via tabs as you would in a browser.<\/p>\n<h2>Server Monitoring Features<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The basics are there, such as CPU and memory usage, disk read and write percentage statistics for each of your servers. You can follow in real time usage of each application, the bandwidth and users of each server. For websites you may track general site availability and look more specifically at response time at different point as well as having the visibility over average, minimum and maximum response times.<\/p>\n<h2>Monitor Your Servers at Any Time and from Any Place<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A very important feature of our software is that you can tailor and get alerts. Beyond the comprehensive tables of alerts available in the Alerts tab of the TSplus Server Monitoring Dashboard, you can choose to receive email or Teams notifications whenever there is an alert, thus speeding up considerably response times when you are not in front of your screen.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">They will inform you when certain thresholds or criteria are reached. You can decide to be notified should any server memory fill to 90% or if they run on too great a percentage of their RAM capacity, or you could set different thresholds per server. You can receive emails for server downtime as well as concerning any website.<\/p>\n<h2>Generate Reports<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can generate reports for your servers and websites, choose aspects according to your audience or needs and visually tailor them to your company colours. It is also possible for these reports to be automatically emailed according to filters you can create and amend.<\/p>\n<h2>Easy-to-use Server Monitoring Software<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>In conclusion, TSplus Server Monitoring is a user-friendly and very efficient tool for monitoring server and websites wherever you are and whatever the time.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>From one server and website to server farms and multiple websites, our software, available for a <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/download\/\">free 15-day trial<\/a>, will be all set within a few clicks, to keep you on top of your monitoring tasks today.<\/b><\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

<h2>Opening Businesses to the Internet – Remote Working</h2>
<strong>
Today, businesses are taking advantage of the Internet to deliver their apps and services to users in ways that weren’t possible 20 years ago. For many businesses, offering remote working has been a necessity to effectively compete with other businesses in their market.</strong>
Web-based access offers many advantages for your company. For example, it can enable you to serve a wider range of users without the associated expansion of corporate office space. Integrating the Internet in your business can also mean increased profits and decreased cost of operations.
<h2>Internet Security Issues Raised by Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, <a href="https://tsplus.net/">Remote Desktop</a> and web-enabled apps need proper deployment planning and tools to be safe and secure. With more and more businesses turning to a web delivery model for their corporate applications, hackers and other bad actors have targeted remote desktop services as a way to wreak havoc and steal information.</p>

<h2>Cyber-security against Cyber-crime</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote environments of all types can be vulnerable to this kind of crime. Exposing corporate servers to the internet makes your services more widely available – but it does carry some inherent risks if not done properly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is why it is so important that businesses get an internet security program for their remote working infrastructure. Protecting businesses from malicious software and people who want to gain access to crucial business data brings us to TSplus Advanced Security.</p>

<h2>TSplus Advanced Security – All-in-One Cyber-Security Tool</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today, there are very few Internet security programs that you can take advantage of to protect your remote desktop servers from hackers, ransomware, and other intrusions. Most of the security programs available are targeted at viruses. And while helpful, that single functionality does not cover the biggest threats that internet-facing enterprises face.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is why you we recommend you look for an Internet security software program that can effectively protect servers from all types of risks circulating the Internet today. <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> is such a product. We designed it to keep our Remote Access and Remote Support users safe on every front while they are online using our software.</p>

<h2>Protection Against Numerous Online Dangers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beyond viruses, here are three of the main threats faced by remote infrastructures today:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">• <strong>Brute Force Attacks –</strong> A classic attack method that any internet-facing server can be subject to. Repeated attempts to guess login credentials. Usually run by automated bots. Not only a security risk if the attack is successful since the simple existence of the attack can negatively impact server performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">• <strong>Ransomware Attacks –</strong> The last 5 years have seen a plague of ransomware attacks in both private and public spheres. Businesses and governments alike are being shaken down by internet gangs for millions of dollars to recover maliciously encrypted information. Remote working infrastructures require particular care to protect them against such attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">• <strong>Coordinated Intrusion Attempts –</strong> While similar to brute force attacks, coordinated intrusion attempts are generally targeted, and sometimes involve more human intervention. These types of attacks often come from known hacker groups with equally well-known IP clusters from which their activity originates.</p>

<h2>Winning Combination for Cybersecurity</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>These are just a few of the types of attacks against which TSplus Advanced Security was designed to protect your IT and remote infrastructure. When combined with the Two-Factor Authentication functionality of TSplus Remote Access, client connections are secure, users are safe and corporate data is protected.</strong></p>

		<strong>Virtualization software and remote desktop access software are changing the way manufacturers make computer hardware and the way companies do business, and they are also affecting how employees work their average week and how data centres are managed and run.</strong> These changes have come out of practicality as well as necessity and seem set to affect more than just the near, predictable future.<h2>Virtual! Remote! Tomorrow? Today!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote Desktop Services have over the past decade or two, become an intrinsic part of almost every PC. It looks set to save many a company a great deal of time and money, not least because training can now be done online from just about anywhere and support provides likewise. Virtualization software has been literally forced upon the IT industry by the drastic need for greater multi-core chip architecture and a demand for greater ways to save on energy costs. Virtualization software is a technology that has also consolidated its position in the IT industry and is set to grow.</p>
<h2>Virtualization or Publication to Get Apps Online</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Virtualization software is believed to be the brainchild of a Californian company called VMware, little less than a decade old. Seeing the potential of virtualization software, IT heavy weights have invested greatly in the company in the past. These leaders in the field of computer technology have realized the need to bend technology in a way to accommodate virtualization software and take advantage of the full scope of virtualization software.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote Desktop Services is driven by another IT giant. Microsoft has seen the potential of it being used from their machines. <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus Remote Access</a> uses the Remote Desktop Protocol inherent to Windows PCs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is clear that this possibility of using one piece of hardware to access the contents of another and use it has grown central to a whole portion of the population globally. Whether it is done by projecting the object onto other devices or by virtually running it elsewhere, many companies and workers could no longer do without distant access or application publishing.</p>
<h2>More about Virtualization Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">What is virtualization software and where it is used? It is a software technology that does away with the need for running multiple servers. With virtualization software, administrators of data centers can configure one physical server to run multiple operating systems simultaneously as if the operating systems were running on multiple machines simultaneously. This saves on the cost of investing in multiple servers without having to increase the resources of the single server. This also saves on huge costs of peripheral network devices such as network switches and hubs. Thus, virtualization software leads to massive savings on hardware costs, energy bills and maintenance costs as well, at the same time increasing utility and efficiency of the machine the virtualization software is installed on.</p>
<h2>More about Remote Desktop Services</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote Desktop Services makes any PC into a server, meaning technicians can then use this server to make its applications and data available remotely from elsewhere. Once more, we can see the savings this can incur. From one server device, we can deploy any of the applications it contains so great numbers of users can run this application on the server from pretty much any remote device. No more need for countless copies of the same software and applications, to be installed and updated repetitively on endless numbers of machines. Exit software incompatibility and the negative weight of the word “legacy”. Gone, so many interventions and support issues thanks to the possibility of carrying them out from afar. The only real restriction is the need for an Internet connection. But, since the remote device only displays the image but doesn’t run the actual application, very little data transits. Therefore, it doesn’t even have to be a brilliant connection: the café or hotel Wi-Fi will most likely be enough.</p>
<h2>Remote seems to be the way forwards, whichever path you choose.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">At TSplus we have chosen remote desktop access to make application publication accessible to the greatest number. For this, we can thank the inventiveness of our development team, the skill of our support team and the good sense of our sales and marketing teams.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a>, just like any of our products, has been designed and developed with safety, efficiency and fluidity in mind. Moreover, this user-friendly software is affordable, with permanent licenses and Support &amp; Update available for a fraction of most competitors’ software on the market.

		<strong>
With the advent of computer viruses of all kinds, antivirus software installation in PCs has long been a necessity.</strong> Antivirus software comprises computer programs which strive to identify viruses and 'malware' (other malicious software), thwart their endeavours and eliminate them altogether.<strong> But is that enough to protect your IT setup?</strong><h2>About Antivirus Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">An antivirus software program may come installed on your computer or may be purchased and installed by you. There are quite a few 'invaders' against which a computer needs to be protected. There are viruses, worms, Trojans and so on. The best antivirus software available is geared to offer protection against the whole range of such known viruses and malware.</p>
<h2>Protection From Cyber-Threats</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The potential damages that viruses can inflict include:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">deletion of files,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">unauthorized access to personal data,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">usage of the computer as a platform to carry out attack on other computers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These can normally be thwarted by installing at least one of the top ten antivirus software products. Now, with the types of cyber-threats evolving and on the rise, it turns out this is generally no longer enough.</p>
<h2>Techniques Used by Antivirus Software to Protect Your IT Setup</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Antivirus software usually uses two alternative techniques. It scans files for viruses that match the definitions given in virus dictionaries or it identifies potential infection indicated by suspicious behaviour from some computer program. Usually, the best free antivirus software adopts both the techniques in parallel.</p>
<h2>Antivirus Software Protect Your IT Setup Doesn’t Have to be Expensive</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of the best antivirus software comes for free. However, the best antivirus software packages put special emphasis on the virus dictionary matching approach.</p>
<h2>What Antivirus Software Can’t Look Out For</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the years, the type of attacks has evolved. For instance, data theft has seen an alarming increase, from password cracking to identity theft through to full blown company data theft and ransoming. Another thing that has changed are the inroads for attacks have multiplied. Email is still a favourite in some cases with dangerous links or impersonations, as are infected files.</p>
<h2>From Hacking to Prove a Skill to a Rush for “Easy money”</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">But there are currently many individuals and groups pretending to be in need or in dire circumstances and sending phoney calls for help to extort large amounts of money. Sometimes this can even take the shape of an online shop with offers that are too good to be true. The whole thing turning out to be a hoax once the credit card details are through. Similar ideas are at play in emails to various department within companies trying to reach particular staff to push them to share credentials or make rash decisions that will compromise a company’s data or finances.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is also the outright use of password cracking devices or software which can be targeted at networks, via Wi-Fi amongst other routes. Many attacks are directly aimed at servers by malicious IPs. These may, for example, attempt to insert themselves into verified exchanges and try to impersonate one of the parties. Or they may simply listen in until they can steal some useful information. Crashing servers, destroying information that can’t be stolen, anything seems to become fair game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whatever the motivations, all of this can prove destructive for companies and individuals. But <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus</a> has developed a solution for complete protection.</p>
<h2>Features to Look for to get the Best Cyber-Protection</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look for the following features in the cyber-security tools you choose:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Simplicity and ease of use of the software so that even a person with little knowledge of computers, viruses or networks can use and install it. TSplus Advanced Security has an ergonomic single administration console. It is easy to navigate via browser-like tabs.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Effectiveness in identifying threats of various kinds. Our software fends off brute-force attacks, blocks a regularly updated list of malicious IP addresses and- hunts out ransomware.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Efficacy in cleaning out or isolating any infected files. This so as to prevent further infection. It is another important feature well worth including. TSplus Advanced Security with even isolate the infected area so the threat cannot spread.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Reactivity in pulling the alarm bell: good communication of threats by the software. In the admin console, you can set who to notify, how etc. via email as well as view the surveillance in real-time.</p>
</li>
</ul>

There are quite a few 'invaders' against which a computer needs to be protected. There are viruses, worms, Trojans and so on. The best antivirus software available is geared to offer protection against the whole range of such known viruses and malware.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Protection From Cyber-Threats<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The potential damages that viruses can inflict include:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">deletion of files,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">unauthorized access to personal data,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">usage of the computer as a platform to carry out attack on other computers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">These can normally be thwarted by installing at least one of the top ten antivirus software products. Now, with the types of cyber-threats evolving and on the rise, it turns out this is generally no longer enough.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Techniques Used by Antivirus Software to Protect Your IT Setup<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Antivirus software usually uses two alternative techniques. It scans files for viruses that match the definitions given in virus dictionaries or it identifies potential infection indicated by suspicious behaviour from some computer program. Usually, the best free antivirus software adopts both the techniques in parallel.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Antivirus Software Protect Your IT Setup Doesn\u2019t Have to be Expensive<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some of the best antivirus software comes for free. However, the best antivirus software packages put special emphasis on the virus dictionary matching approach.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What Antivirus Software Can\u2019t Look Out For<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Over the years, the type of attacks has evolved. For instance, data theft has seen an alarming increase, from password cracking to identity theft through to full blown company data theft and ransoming. Another thing that has changed are the inroads for attacks have multiplied. Email is still a favourite in some cases with dangerous links or impersonations, as are infected files.<\/p>\n\n<h2>From Hacking to Prove a Skill to a Rush for \u201cEasy money\u201d<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But there are currently many individuals and groups pretending to be in need or in dire circumstances and sending phoney calls for help to extort large amounts of money. Sometimes this can even take the shape of an online shop with offers that are too good to be true. The whole thing turning out to be a hoax once the credit card details are through. Similar ideas are at play in emails to various department within companies trying to reach particular staff to push them to share credentials or make rash decisions that will compromise a company\u2019s data or finances.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There is also the outright use of password cracking devices or software which can be targeted at networks, via Wi-Fi amongst other routes. Many attacks are directly aimed at servers by malicious IPs. These may, for example, attempt to insert themselves into verified exchanges and try to impersonate one of the parties. Or they may simply listen in until they can steal some useful information. Crashing servers, destroying information that can\u2019t be stolen, anything seems to become fair game.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whatever the motivations, all of this can prove destructive for companies and individuals. But <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">TSplus<\/a> has developed a solution for complete protection.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Features to Look for to get the Best Cyber-Protection<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Look for the following features in the cyber-security tools you choose:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Simplicity and ease of use of the software so that even a person with little knowledge of computers, viruses or networks can use and install it. TSplus Advanced Security has an ergonomic single administration console. It is easy to navigate via browser-like tabs.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Effectiveness in identifying threats of various kinds. Our software fends off brute-force attacks, blocks a regularly updated list of malicious IP addresses and- hunts out ransomware.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Efficacy in cleaning out or isolating any infected files. This so as to prevent further infection. It is another important feature well worth including. TSplus Advanced Security with even isolate the infected area so the threat cannot spread.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Reactivity in pulling the alarm bell: good communication of threats by the software. In the admin console, you can set who to notify, how etc. via email as well as view the surveillance in real-time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/\">TSplus Advanced Security<\/a> pushes the protection a few steps further by enabling you to choose from which countries users can connect, at what times, from which devices and what rights they have.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Protection is only as strong as its weakest point<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Whatever your antivirus software product, TSplus Advanced Security will ensure high level of security for Windows based PCs and their networks.<\/b> <strong>Come and discover what peace of mind really could mean for your company.<\/strong><b> You can try and test <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">our software<\/a> for 15-days for free.<\/b><\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

<strong>The problem with business travel, to put it bluntly, is that you are not in your office. If you are a manager or a project leader, your still need to stay in touch with your team and what is going on at all times. Continuity is crucial.</strong>
<h2>Never Completely Out of Touch</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It could seem that this need is at cross-purposes with the idea of business travel. But don’t worry, with modern technology and a bit of coordination on your part, you can maintain a reasonable level of connectivity to your important projects and team activities even while driving in the rental car or waiting out a flight at the airport.</p>

<h2>Remote Work Tools and Team Communication Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The actual technology you use to stay connected may change over time. Whereas in the past we could only use pay phones at airports, we have evolved technologically so you can travel and access your network via your cell phone, wireless PC or an assortment of other devices. This said, you will need to put two essentials into place.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first thing you will need is a way to stay in touch with your team cheaply and easily. If you want more than simple phone calls, you probably already have some favourite apps to do this. There are a bounty of possibilities at hand. Maybe we’ll touch on those applications another time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The second thing you will need is a tool to keep your office workstation and company data at your fingertips come what may. That is our field: the field of remote desktops and distant working. So, this is where we step in with <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a>, software to make your desktop available from anywhere on any device, even with low Internet bandwidths.</p>

<h2>Connect to Work Remotely and Take Your Office Wherever You Go</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">An important step is to identify which type of technology satisfies your need for connectivity as well as enabling you to work productively in diverse locations such as the airport, your airplane seat or your hotel room. Here, I’m referring to the laptop, tablet and/or smartphone you plan to use when accessing your desktop remotely while working away.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, that is up to you. Especially since TSplus Remote Access can connects using <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#connection-modes">our built-in customisable Web Portal</a>. This leaves you total freedom of which device you prefer but also which OS you would like to use. You can even have more than one favourite as long as you have an Internet browser in each.</p>

<h2>Equipment Strong Enough for Travelling</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Depending on where and why you are traveling, this could require a little more care and attention. As you conduct a technical review of the available technology, be careful to research the durability of the equipment you are taking on the road. You may be able to afford the most sophisticated equipment on the market today.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But is that equipment going to survive the rigors of travel? Indeed, travelling could include you High-Tech devices being banged around in your luggage, exposed to heat, cold and moisture or just about any other harsh condition you might throw them into? If it isn’t, then it isn’t going to be the kind of equipment you want by your side on a long business trip.</p>

<h2>Hardware and Internet Connectivity to Take Your Office Globetrotting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you have settled on the equipment, you can check how it is configured. Make sure you are all set for internet access as well as the ability to tap into your corporate intranet and network. This is crucial so that you can communicate with your team and access corporate files to stay on top of what is going on with your projects back at the office.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Something to remember if you want to back-up wireless connectivity with a cable, is to check plugs and sockets on your cables and devices as well as what will be available locally since they will need to be compatible.</p>

<h2>Hardware Internet Connectivity for a Global Office</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you have settled on the equipment, you can check how it is configured. Make sure you are all set for internet access as well as the ability to tap into your corporate intranet and network. This is crucial so that you can communicate with your team and access corporate files to stay on top of what is going on with your projects back at the office.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, if your project team file their status reports each Friday morning, you must be able to review those. Then, you will most likely want to give your team directions for any further action. So, you need to be able to communicate with them those items on which they need to work deriving from those reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You will generally need to do this quickly and efficiently, even if you are on a ten-hour flight from Europe. Hence the need for connectivity hardware powerful enough and technology modern enough to be rapid and efficient.</p>

<h2>Mobile Internet Connectivity for Versatile Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nowadays, making sure you can access the Internet is often as simple as checking with your mobile provider that your data is activated. You need mainly to ensure that you can use it freely where you are travelling. If you’ve never used your mobile internet abroad before, this may mean buying a data-pack or ordering a data add-on to be applied to your mobile subscription.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note that it really is worth figuring out in advance how to make your smartphone’s mobile Internet connexion available to your laptop or other devices. Indeed, should the need occur, you may be relieved to use your mobile hot-spot to supercede ad lousy Wi-Fi connexion. Remember that some may be too slow, others might present data security issues, and yet others both. Luckily, Wi-Fi and Internet access is becoming increasingly accessible and reliable.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Case in point, the offer and quality of the access has become something important in most travel or commuting interchanges such as airports and stations as well as in cafes, hotels or public places worldwide. There are also more and more shared office facilities in cities around the globe. These offer you even more potential to easily stay connected to your office while travelling.</p>

<h2>Out-of-Office or Transferred Calls</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To manage your phone contacts, one reflex can involve just putting the “out of office” auto-answer on your office message service. Instead, you could ask admin to forward your office phone-line to your cell phone and receive your phone calls in remote. This will enable you to conduct your business as though you were on site throughout your trip. Additionally, remember all those communication applications mentioned in passing. They open a world of possibilities.</p>

<h2>Work from Anywhere as Though from Your Office</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is currently adequate technology available for you to be able both to access and to operate your desktop computer, left back on your desk at the office, even while traveling. One such service is <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a>. If you’ve never used it before, we offer a 15-day fully featured trial to test our software. See with your IT department what methodology they have enabled for this sort of access so that you can get them involved in your trip planning. They will love the handy and well-designed admin console and you can leave it to them to customise company visuals and other such preferences.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By accessing your PC daily or several times daily, you can continue to use your instance of Microsoft Outlook or whichever email software you prefer. Thus, you can read and respond to important business emails as you relax in your hotel room or by the pool after your business meetings out of town. Thanks to TSplus Remote Access, you won’t need to get used to another machine. Your desktop will be every bit the same as at the office, with all your applications and files in their place.</p>

<h2>Distant Working – a Portable Office</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A customisable Web portal, Session capture, Remote printing, Multi-users, HTML5, these are just a few of the features that make it possible to perform virtually any function remotely just as you could have done only in the office in the past. With our add-ons TSplus Advanced Security and 2FA, you also have the key to ensuring the safety of your connexions is at its highest wherever you may travel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And if you want to turn off your office computer while you are away, no need to worry, you can still access it. Indeed, enter TSplus Remote Support and its Wake-on-LAN capabitlity and unattended access feature. With these on board, you can access your desktop and data with true freedom yet still reduce your carbon footprint.</p>

<h2>TSplus Remote Access: Connected, Anywhere! Anytime!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>So don’t accept the limitations of the road. Investigate how to be fully connected as you go about your business travel. The outcome? You can keep all of your important business projects moving forward simultaneously.</strong> <b>So, for all you need to set-up a remote office in moments, visit the <a href="https://tsplus.net/download/">TSplus download</a> page.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-IT-Support-1024x576.png" alt="title of article, logo and link illustrated by image of computer devices and headsets" loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-IT-Support-1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-IT-Support-300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-IT-Support-768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-IT-Support-18x10.png 18w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-IT-Support.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" width="800" height="450">								</a>
<b>IT support software offers cover a wide range of requirements.</b> <strong>Some companies will choose to outsource IT support. They will need to subscribe to a contract with a provider of such services. Others will keep the job in-house. For them, software is directly available, as it is for companies whose business lies in actual IT support provision.</strong>
<h2>What Kind of Remote IT Support?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not everyone will need all the services available, whether from a provider or from a specific piece of software. Clients should preferably select a provider who allows clients to tailor features and lines of support to their specific needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One point to clarify in particular is the kinds of response to expect to support requests. Support company responses and client expectations can vary widely in this matter.</p>

<h2>Tailoring Remote IT Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the above aspects in mind, let us delve into the main specifics of IT support. This way we can better see the shape of IT contracts on one hand and what support software has to offer on the other. We can then quickly present <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-work/">TSplus Remote Support</a>.</p>

<h2>Typical Terms of a Remote IT Support Contract</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Any contract should be clear about the items supported.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">EQUIPMENT: An IT setup will typically have servers, PCs, Laptops, Printers and so on. Which specific items will receive support?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">AGE LIMITATIONS: Are there any clauses that put a limit on the age of the equipment that will be supported?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">SOFTWARE: Clients will be using many kinds of software such as server software, desktop OS, functional software like Payroll, system protection software like Anti-Virus, etc. Installing and configuring some of these pieces of software can be a daunting task. The software can crash during operations. Identify which software will be supported? What kind of support will be provided, e.g., will there be any support for installation and configuration or upgrades?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">HOME USERS: Under flexible working arrangements, many users might be working with company equipment from their homes. Will they be supported?</p>

<h2>IT and Support Referee</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whether support is in-house or sub-contracted, it is important to designate a specified person to be responsible for the preliminary fault identification and troubleshooting. This person will be the main contact person with the IT support company or the IT team.</p>

<h2>Remote IT Support By In-House IT Staff</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nowadays, the number of non-IT companies with an IT department have dwindled. Nonetheless, for a company managing its own IT support, the above questions will have their place. The answers will rule a substantial part of what support tasks the company’s IT team may have to deal with on a daily basis, as well as potential capabilities of the software they will need to perform their tasks.</p>

<h2>How the Support Is Provided</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">HOW: Typically, support is provided via email or chat or over the telephone first. This will involve assessing the extent of the problem, where possible guiding the user to rectify the problem by themselves. If this proves unsatisfactory, remote support would be the next step, by accessing the clients system from the support company's or by the in-house support team.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To enable such remote support, a support company might install a VPN connection or a remote desktop support client. The company’s own IT staff will work in the same manner.</p>

<h2>On-Site IT Support as a Last Resort</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the event of this also proving insufficient, a site visit may be needed. This process will be made more effective by a good understanding of exactly how a support request will be handled. It will also drive how well the service will be escalated to a higher level.</p>

<h2>Response Times in Remote IT Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">WHEN: Response times can differ with different kinds of problems. Server problems will need to be attended without delay. How much delay is provided in the service contract? Desktop problems can afford some delay. It makes sense to avoid insisting on expensively short response times for these.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With regards to response times, the availability of remote access and the Internet have extensively broadened flexibility. Indeed, remote connections enable greater efficiency and responsiveness from support staff. They also mean clients receive support faster and at more convenient times, including while they are away from their workstation.</p>

<h2>Some Last Aspects of Remote IT Support Contracts</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">IT support contracts will typically also contain certain obligations on a client’s part. Some major obligations are listed below. Check that what arrangements have been made to meet all such obligations.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Try not to make system changes without prior consent of the support company.</li>
 	<li>Do regular housekeeping activities like backups, testing the backups, and so on (check who is responsible for these tasks and who is responsible for data recovery should the need arise).</li>
 	<li>Pay bills as agreed in any contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">There will also be certain exclusions from the scope of support. Pre-existing faults and support for functional software such as accounting are examples of typical exclusions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, there will typically be a clause on how to resolve disputes.</p>

<h2>For Remote IT Support Providers or in-house IT teams, TSplus Remote Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If it’s not already done, the time will come for choosing the tool for the job. TSplus developers have been at work on different remote access tools these past years and TSplus Remote Support is growing and improving with the company. It is worth noting that our software is self-hosted for your data and network security.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">
<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hosted-or-local-Applications-1024x576.png" alt="title of article, logo and link, illustrated by picture of a man holding computer devices" loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hosted-or-local-Applications-1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hosted-or-local-Applications-300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hosted-or-local-Applications-768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hosted-or-local-Applications-18x10.png 18w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hosted-or-local-Applications.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" width="800" height="450">								</a>

Due to the advent of ADSL and Fibre and global efforts to democratise access to the Internet, Web access has become more widespread with faster, more reliable and 'always on' connections becoming the norm. In parallel, the use of <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">remotely accessed</a> or hosted applications continues to expand. <strong>Let us see how cloud or locally hosted applications will suit varied situations and customers, bringing benefits both similar and different to many individuals and organizations.</strong>
<h2>What is a Hosted Application?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unlike standard set-ups where software is installed locally and in-house, hosted application set-ups belong to the not so old concept of the Cloud and could need a little explaining.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A hosted application may be called Internet-based application, web-based application, online application and is available from Application Service Providers (ASPs). Each of these describes any software application where the software resides on servers that are accessed through the Internet instead of being installed on either a local server or on individual PC's.There are numerous examples of hosted applications providers. Their fields range across many areas of business.</p>

<h2>Thin Clients as a Derived Benefit of Networking</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Thin Client concept is nothing new but advances in Internet connectivity have allowed the applications to be available from remote servers accessed over the Internet as well as from local servers and networks.</p>

<h2>Low Maintenance for Published and Hosted Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With hosted applications the hardware and software are the responsibility of the vendor, while the client only has to maintain access to the Internet. As there is no software to download, a hosted application can be made instantly available across an entire organization even where the organization has multiple regional and international offices. Cutting on multiple installations also completely eliminates the considerable time and resources required for periodic updates.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With application publishing, all the same benefits come into play for different reasons with an added perk. Since everything remains on the company servers, wherever they may be, there is still no installation or downloading. The remote access enables the appearance of the application to be projected on the distant devices, according to any permissions given (whole desktop, particular applications, a floating panel, specific files…) to the various users.</p>

<h2>Added Perk of Application Publishing</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The inestimable added advantage of publishing applications to the Web with <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus</a> is that they are the exact ones you’ve always used, no learning curve involved. And of course, it works for all your legacy applications too, seamlessly.</p>

<h2>Reduced Cost of Published and Hosted Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The need to license software through a 'per user', 'per concurrent user', 'per server' or 'site' license is often absent for Web hosted applications since many have taken the opportunity to charge on a 'usage' and/or 'period' basis. Customers need not estimate the number of licenses required, nor install and pay for full licenses that may only be used by some employees occasionally.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus has chosen to keep the scalability of the 'per user', 'per server' calculation as it enables companies to grow their set-up with their business.</p>

<h2>Minimal Risk with Published and Hosted Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many hosted applications require no long-term commitment from their customers. New customers can often test hosted applications either through a free introductory offer or with minimal risk using a Pay-As-You-Go model. If after the trial the customer finds it unsuitable, then they can simply stop using the service. Similarly, TSplus Remote Access licenses can be tried for 15 days for free before buying.</p>

<h2>Access to Published and Hosted Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With both methods, applications and data are available to the authorized clients once they have logged on from anywhere with Internet access. Users can now work anywhere in the office environment, from remote offices or from their home or hotel without the need to download their work or synchronize with portable devices.</p>

<h2>Integration of Published and Hosted Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">For organizations that have legacy systems from different suppliers running different operating systems hosted applications may provide an integrated solution. With <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a>, there is no doubt your legacy applications will go anywhere you go.</p>

<h2>Support of Published and Hosted Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Neither option need maintain multiple versions or individual maintenance and licensing agreements. New updates are installed centrally negating the need for expensive roll outs. In some cases, a user may request a new feature in the morning that can be developed, tested and deployed globally by the afternoon.</p>

<h2>Any Concerns?</h2>
<h2>Internet access for Published and Hosted Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">New communication technology is able to bring high speed Internet connectivity to more and more remote places but there are still some regions where internet access is limited or not available.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In some cases, although high speed Internet connectivity is available, costs in terms of connectivity charges and equipment may prove to be prohibitive, at least in the short term.</p>

<h2>Security &amp; Data Protection with Published and Hosted Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As with everything to do with the Internet security is a justified concern. Solutions to a security issue will depend on the specific hosted application and the nature of the data. Anyhow, vendors should be able to provide their clients with sufficient confidence that the data is secure and that any private information remains private. With TSplus Remote Access, much of these security aspects are safe behind the company firewall since no actual company data or information is processed out on the Internet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Providers will normally operate a login procedure ensuring that only those that are authorized have access. The more sensitive the data, the more sophisticated the login procedure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A good data host will strictly implement the stated wishes of their customers and ensure that data is not available or released to anyone that is not legally entitled to see it. They will also adopt the latest security measures available to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some areas, for example automatic logins from known PCs or the use of cookies, may not seem a direct risk. They nonetheless present dangers under certain circumstances, such as gaining access to a private account through the automatic login using an unattended PC. Although strictly speaking the customer's responsibility the customer should be made aware of the risks so that they can take action to safeguard their own system. This is where <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#security">TSplus 2FA</a> and <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> play their part, ensuring unwanted access is cut down due to the extra pass-code plus features like working hours and home country.</p>

<h2>Vendor Lock-In with Subscriptions</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As with any subscription there is a risk that a customer could become locked-in to paying costly repeat fees to maintain access to their historic data. To counter this some applications will allow the data to be downloaded or allow customer to maintain access to their data for a reasonable time free of charge. TSplus avoids this by storing none of a company’s data.</p>

<h2>Control of Published and Hosted Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some may prefer application publishing simply because they want to keep control. Indeed, remotely hosted hardware and software is under the control of a third party. Though justifiable, this concern is similar to telephone providers supplying and maintaining the communications equipment. It is in the vendors’ interest to ensure high availability and reliability since their business depends on it.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overall, it is clear that according to the size of the company and its potential remote use of applications, you may have a preference straight off.</strong> <b>TSplus has chosen application publishing for its affordability, ease of set-up and maintenance and simplicity of management and upkeep.</b> <strong>To test our solutions for free,</strong> <b><a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">click here</a></b>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In parallel, the use of <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/\">remotely accessed<\/a> or hosted applications continues to expand. <strong>Let us see how cloud or locally hosted applications will suit varied situations and customers, bringing benefits both similar and different to many individuals and organizations.<\/strong><\/p>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>What is a Hosted Application?<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Unlike standard set-ups where software is installed locally and in-house, hosted application set-ups belong to the not so old concept of the Cloud and could need a little explaining.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A hosted application may be called Internet-based application, web-based application, online application and is available from Application Service Providers (ASPs). Each of these describes any software application where the software resides on servers that are accessed through the Internet instead of being installed on either a local server or on individual PC's.There are numerous examples of hosted applications providers. Their fields range across many areas of business.<\/p><h2>Thin Clients as a Derived Benefit of Networking<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Thin Client concept is nothing new but advances in Internet connectivity have allowed the applications to be available from remote servers accessed over the Internet as well as from local servers and networks.<\/p><h2>Low Maintenance for Published and Hosted Applications<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With hosted applications the hardware and software are the responsibility of the vendor, while the client only has to maintain access to the Internet. As there is no software to download, a hosted application can be made instantly available across an entire organization even where the organization has multiple regional and international offices. Cutting on multiple installations also completely eliminates the considerable time and resources required for periodic updates.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With application publishing, all the same benefits come into play for different reasons with an added perk. Since everything remains on the company servers, wherever they may be, there is still no installation or downloading. The remote access enables the appearance of the application to be projected on the distant devices, according to any permissions given (whole desktop, particular applications, a floating panel, specific files\u2026) to the various users.<\/p><h2>Added Perk of Application Publishing<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The inestimable added advantage of publishing applications to the Web with <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">TSplus<\/a> is that they are the exact ones you\u2019ve always used, no learning curve involved. And of course, it works for all your legacy applications too, seamlessly.<\/p><h2>Reduced Cost of Published and Hosted Applications<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The need to license software through a 'per user', 'per concurrent user', 'per server' or 'site' license is often absent for Web hosted applications since many have taken the opportunity to charge on a 'usage' and\/or 'period' basis. Customers need not estimate the number of licenses required, nor install and pay for full licenses that may only be used by some employees occasionally.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">TSplus has chosen to keep the scalability of the 'per user', 'per server' calculation as it enables companies to grow their set-up with their business.<\/p><h2>Minimal Risk with Published and Hosted Applications<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many hosted applications require no long-term commitment from their customers. New customers can often test hosted applications either through a free introductory offer or with minimal risk using a Pay-As-You-Go model. If after the trial the customer finds it unsuitable, then they can simply stop using the service. Similarly, TSplus Remote Access licenses can be tried for 15 days for free before buying.<\/p><h2>Access to Published and Hosted Applications<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With both methods, applications and data are available to the authorized clients once they have logged on from anywhere with Internet access. Users can now work anywhere in the office environment, from remote offices or from their home or hotel without the need to download their work or synchronize with portable devices.<\/p><h2>Integration of Published and Hosted Applications<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For organizations that have legacy systems from different suppliers running different operating systems hosted applications may provide an integrated solution. With <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/\">TSplus Remote Access<\/a>, there is no doubt your legacy applications will go anywhere you go.<\/p><h2>Support of Published and Hosted Applications<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Neither option need maintain multiple versions or individual maintenance and licensing agreements. New updates are installed centrally negating the need for expensive roll outs. In some cases, a user may request a new feature in the morning that can be developed, tested and deployed globally by the afternoon.<\/p><h2>Any Concerns?<\/h2><h2>Internet access for Published and Hosted Applications<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">New communication technology is able to bring high speed Internet connectivity to more and more remote places but there are still some regions where internet access is limited or not available.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In some cases, although high speed Internet connectivity is available, costs in terms of connectivity charges and equipment may prove to be prohibitive, at least in the short term.<\/p><h2>Security &amp; Data Protection with Published and Hosted Applications<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As with everything to do with the Internet security is a justified concern. Solutions to a security issue will depend on the specific hosted application and the nature of the data. Anyhow, vendors should be able to provide their clients with sufficient confidence that the data is secure and that any private information remains private. With TSplus Remote Access, much of these security aspects are safe behind the company firewall since no actual company data or information is processed out on the Internet.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Providers will normally operate a login procedure ensuring that only those that are authorized have access. The more sensitive the data, the more sophisticated the login procedure.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A good data host will strictly implement the stated wishes of their customers and ensure that data is not available or released to anyone that is not legally entitled to see it. They will also adopt the latest security measures available to prevent unauthorized access.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some areas, for example automatic logins from known PCs or the use of cookies, may not seem a direct risk. They nonetheless present dangers under certain circumstances, such as gaining access to a private account through the automatic login using an unattended PC. Although strictly speaking the customer's responsibility the customer should be made aware of the risks so that they can take action to safeguard their own system. This is where <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/features\/#security\">TSplus 2FA<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/\">TSplus Advanced Security<\/a> play their part, ensuring unwanted access is cut down due to the extra pass-code plus features like working hours and home country.<\/p><h2>Vendor Lock-In with Subscriptions<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As with any subscription there is a risk that a customer could become locked-in to paying costly repeat fees to maintain access to their historic data. To counter this some applications will allow the data to be downloaded or allow customer to maintain access to their data for a reasonable time free of charge. TSplus avoids this by storing none of a company\u2019s data.<\/p><h2>Control of Published and Hosted Applications<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some may prefer application publishing simply because they want to keep control. Indeed, remotely hosted hardware and software is under the control of a third party. Though justifiable, this concern is similar to telephone providers supplying and maintaining the communications equipment. It is in the vendors\u2019 interest to ensure high availability and reliability since their business depends on it.<\/p><h2>In Conclusion<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Overall, it is clear that according to the size of the company and its potential remote use of applications, you may have a preference straight off.<\/strong> <b>TSplus has chosen application publishing for its affordability, ease of set-up and maintenance and simplicity of management and upkeep.<\/b> <strong>To test our solutions for free,<\/strong> <b><a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/\">click here<\/a><\/b>.<\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A higher percentage than ever of computer users are now informed enough to know they must have security products deployed in order to protect their computers.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the case of corporate users, the IT staff makes sure their gateway is stacked with the latest and greatest security appliances protecting the perimeter. In the case of home users, the users themselves make sure to install security software, typically a combination of personal firewall, antivirus and anti-spam. Or a single streamlined Internet Security Suite.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>In both cases, the solution is simply not good enough! But <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus</a> has a way.</strong></p>

<h2>How Safe is my IT Set-up?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">We’ll start by explaining why security software running on top of the computer it aims to protect will always be inferior to an external hardware solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The following points are well known to IT professionals. They would obviously never rely on software installed on users’ computers alone. Also, they will always focus on the hardware-based security appliances protecting the organization’s perimeter.</p>

<h2>Hardware Protection for a Safe Network</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The advantages of external hardware-based security appliances are:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Immunity from the inherent vulnerabilities of the underlying OS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If, for instance, an organization is running MS Windows on all its computers, the security software installed on the computer will still suffer from the same underlying vulnerabilities and backdoors that Windows inherently has. When you are protected by an external appliance which has its own proprietary OS (or similar), the security mechanism does not suffer from these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Mobile code is not run</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Content arriving from the internet is not executed on these appliances it just goes or does not go through into the network. This makes it more difficult to attack as the mobile code delivered by the hackers does not run on the appliances.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Cannot be uninstalled</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Security attacks often start by targeting the security software, while trying to uninstall it or stop its activity. Software-based security solutions, as any software program, includes an uninstall option that can be targeted. In contrast, hardware-based security appliances cannot be uninstalled as they are hard coded into the hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Non-writable Memory</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hardware-based solutions manage the memory in a restricted and controlled manner. The security appliances can prohibit access to its memory, providing greater protection against attacks on the security mechanism.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Controlled by IT personnel</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Security appliances are controlled by IT, who constantly maintain the highest security policies and updates.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Security appliances are optimized for maximum security and operate independently from computers in the network, not degrading the performance of the desktops or consuming their resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Prevent potential software conflicts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The security application you install on your computer will reside on the same computer with an unknown amount of other unknown software all using the same CPU, memory, OS and other resources. This often results in various conflicts, “friendly fire” between 2 or more unrelated security application installed on the same computer etc. When using a dedicated hardware security appliance, nothing runs except for the intended use it was made for.</p>

<h2>Hardware Better than Software Alone</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">So closed networks based on hardware solutions guard against these general conceptual problems. Protecting a computer with the exclusive reliance on an installed software security application seems to be insufficient.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There’s a lot more to be said about the problems with software-only solutions. The lack of Network Address Translation (as you’d get in a dedicated external hardware-based security appliance), lack of physical network separation (DMZ), the fact that even simple ARP poisoning attack cannot be stopped by them and much, much more.</p>

<h2>Current Security Solutions Insufficient?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since we’ve clearly established that using software-based security applications is not the ideal security solution, why do so many rely on it? What is wrong with the hardware based security that Corporate Users get? Especially when the IT staff does make sure their gateway is stacked with the latest and greatest security appliances to protect their perimeter. It would appear that that would remain the best way to go. So where is the problem?</p>

<h2>What is the Problem with Closed Networks?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The answer to that is simple – <strong>Mobility</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">More and more of the corporate users actually have laptops and no desktop computers. More and more users are becoming mobile, working remotely from outside the organization, working from home, or are simply on the road traveling as part of their business duties.</p>

<h2>Downfall of the Hardware Solution: Opening a Door</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The minute the user packs up his laptop and leaves the protected (by a series of dedicated hardware security appliances) organizational perimeter – all the amount of money and professional effort that went into building up the corporate gateway, all of that becomes meaningless!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The user has left the corporate protection behind and is left essentially “naked” only with the software security solution as his sole protection. And we’ve already established above it is no longer enough.</p>

<h2>How To Secure Remote Access?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, where to turn? What can be done to secure connections that so easily leave the back door open?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To start with, as part of <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSPlus </a>Remote Access and Remote Work software bundles, we offer 2FA to add minimum extra security in the form of a code used in addition to the standard password. Then we developed <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a>. We pride ourselves that our remote access software is one step closer to being highly secure than the average product on the market, because with TSplus Remote Access or our other software, your company data does not leave the safe perimeter behind your firewall. For the said firewall to remain unscalable, 2FA and TSplus Advanced Security were essentially common sense.</p>

<h2>Lock the Weakest Points for All-round Protection</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>This way the powerful corporate-level security can be re-instated even as the user is away from the protected corporate perimeter,</strong> allowing the distant user maximum performance and productivity (by offloading it and using external security applications, instead of device-installed ones), giving them the highest possible level of security. <strong>It also allows the IT department the means to monitor and enforce security policies over remote and traveling laptops without being intrusive to their users!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>TSplus Advanced Security will protect your network, whatever makes it up.</b> <b> You can try and test <a href="https://tsplus.net/">our software</a> for 15-days for free.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

In the case of home users, the users themselves make sure to install security software, typically a combination of personal firewall, antivirus and anti-spam. Or a single streamlined Internet Security Suite.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>In both cases, the solution is simply not good enough! But <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/\">TSplus<\/a> has a way.<\/strong><\/p>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>How Safe is my IT Set-up?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We\u2019ll start by explaining why security software running on top of the computer it aims to protect will always be inferior to an external hardware solution.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The following points are well known to IT professionals. They would obviously never rely on software installed on users\u2019 computers alone. Also, they will always focus on the hardware-based security appliances protecting the organization\u2019s perimeter.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Hardware Protection for a Safe Network<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The advantages of external hardware-based security appliances are:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Immunity from the inherent vulnerabilities of the underlying OS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If, for instance, an organization is running MS Windows on all its computers, the security software installed on the computer will still suffer from the same underlying vulnerabilities and backdoors that Windows inherently has. When you are protected by an external appliance which has its own proprietary OS (or similar), the security mechanism does not suffer from these vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Mobile code is not run<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Content arriving from the internet is not executed on these appliances it just goes or does not go through into the network. This makes it more difficult to attack as the mobile code delivered by the hackers does not run on the appliances.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Cannot be uninstalled<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Security attacks often start by targeting the security software, while trying to uninstall it or stop its activity. Software-based security solutions, as any software program, includes an uninstall option that can be targeted. In contrast, hardware-based security appliances cannot be uninstalled as they are hard coded into the hardware.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Non-writable Memory<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Hardware-based solutions manage the memory in a restricted and controlled manner. The security appliances can prohibit access to its memory, providing greater protection against attacks on the security mechanism.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Controlled by IT personnel<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Security appliances are controlled by IT, who constantly maintain the highest security policies and updates.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Performance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Security appliances are optimized for maximum security and operate independently from computers in the network, not degrading the performance of the desktops or consuming their resources.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Prevent potential software conflicts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The security application you install on your computer will reside on the same computer with an unknown amount of other unknown software all using the same CPU, memory, OS and other resources. This often results in various conflicts, \u201cfriendly fire\u201d between 2 or more unrelated security application installed on the same computer etc. When using a dedicated hardware security appliance, nothing runs except for the intended use it was made for.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Hardware Better than Software Alone<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So closed networks based on hardware solutions guard against these general conceptual problems. Protecting a computer with the exclusive reliance on an installed software security application seems to be insufficient.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There\u2019s a lot more to be said about the problems with software-only solutions. The lack of Network Address Translation (as you\u2019d get in a dedicated external hardware-based security appliance), lack of physical network separation (DMZ), the fact that even simple ARP poisoning attack cannot be stopped by them and much, much more.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Current Security Solutions Insufficient?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since we\u2019ve clearly established that using software-based security applications is not the ideal security solution, why do so many rely on it? What is wrong with the hardware based security that Corporate Users get? Especially when the IT staff does make sure their gateway is stacked with the latest and greatest security appliances to protect their perimeter. It would appear that that would remain the best way to go. So where is the problem?<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is the Problem with Closed Networks?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The answer to that is simple \u2013 <strong>Mobility<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">More and more of the corporate users actually have laptops and no desktop computers. More and more users are becoming mobile, working remotely from outside the organization, working from home, or are simply on the road traveling as part of their business duties.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Downfall of the Hardware Solution: Opening a Door<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The minute the user packs up his laptop and leaves the protected (by a series of dedicated hardware security appliances) organizational perimeter \u2013 all the amount of money and professional effort that went into building up the corporate gateway, all of that becomes meaningless!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The user has left the corporate protection behind and is left essentially \u201cnaked\u201d only with the software security solution as his sole protection. And we\u2019ve already established above it is no longer enough.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How To Secure Remote Access?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, where to turn? What can be done to secure connections that so easily leave the back door open?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To start with, as part of <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">TSPlus <\/a>Remote Access and Remote Work software bundles, we offer 2FA to add minimum extra security in the form of a code used in addition to the standard password. Then we developed <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/\">TSplus Advanced Security<\/a>. We pride ourselves that our remote access software is one step closer to being highly secure than the average product on the market, because with TSplus Remote Access or our other software, your company data does not leave the safe perimeter behind your firewall. For the said firewall to remain unscalable, 2FA and TSplus Advanced Security were essentially common sense.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Lock the Weakest Points for All-round Protection<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>This way the powerful corporate-level security can be re-instated even as the user is away from the protected corporate perimeter,<\/strong> allowing the distant user maximum performance and productivity (by offloading it and using external security applications, instead of device-installed ones), giving them the highest possible level of security. <strong>It also allows the IT department the means to monitor and enforce security policies over remote and traveling laptops without being intrusive to their users!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>TSplus Advanced Security will protect your network, whatever makes it up.<\/b> <b> You can try and test <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">our software<\/a> for 15-days for free.<\/b><\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Work &amp; Collaborate Remotely</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many software vendors offer remote collaboration software making remote work possible over the Internet. They provide a new way to co-operate, made up of user-friendly instruments for the creation of a <strong>“virtual office”</strong>, designed for professional use, equipped with all the features and the services needed to ensure high performance and above all the highest security in using it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus Software</a> is a set of tools that makes the office workstation available and secure from anywhere via a browser. Just add your favourite visio-networking software and you can collaborate from any place on the globe.</strong></p>

<h2>Work &amp; Collaborate Remotely</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Access is targeted at professionals, from Small and Medium Companies, Organizations, Work Groups, etc. It has a combination of aims. A primary aim is to increase efficiency in and out of the office by making distant working seamless and in keeping with what is possible at the office. At TSplus, we think this should be done simply and securely but without breaking the bank.</p>

<h2>Affordable Remote Work Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Networking software can improve the collaboration among colleagues and with suppliers and clients located wherever they may be in the World. Adding a user-friendly remote working tool to that is all it takes to get your staff mobile and connected. <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus </a>has chosen to use what is already there to do this: Microsoft RDP. With affordable permanent licenses, a secure product and in-house support, there is nothing left to keep SMBs from distant working as easily as big corporations.</p>

<h2>Connect to Collaborate Remotely</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Looking for a solution to collaborate remotely? You have come to the right place. Indeed, TSplus Remote Access supports secure single sign-on  via our web portal. Once the simple set-up steps completed by the admin or IT team, each authorised user can remotely access their own console session on their office PC from their home computer or tablet, as though they were at their desk. All they need is their credentials, their favourite browser and an Internet connection.</p>

<h2>Secure Distant Work Features</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Access presents a great range of built-in functions developed and supported by our own in-house teams:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is self-hosted on-premises or in the cloud on a single server acting as a gateway, brokering connections between remote users and their office desktops. Thanks to this, no company data is ever out in the open.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">SSL certificates are a clear mark of security, stamping your HTTPS connection with validity. 2FA is included in bundles with TSplus Remote Access. Frequent security updates keep your products up to date via our Update/Support package. TSplus Advanced Security is a perfect add-on which will make online traffic safe and keep threats at bay.</p>

<h2>Simple User-friendly Remote Collaboration</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus as a company targets simplicity and ease of use for all its products. Customers can therefore expect user-friendly tools. The TSplus Remote Work console is part of these. The Admin Tool has been designed and developed for a fluid experience in all steps: from initial set-up, through user, appearance and settings configuration, to portal customisation and branding.</p>

<h2>Work Remotely like at the Office</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">All the essential features needed in a remote work tool are present. First there are Remote Access, of course, and the Web Portal for connection from any browser and on any device. Then there is Session Capture which enables users to pick up where they left off to finish tasks and work in progress. Next, you have the all-important Remote Printing possibilities. And then, Multiple Users, makes it possible for users on different shifts to share remote access on a same workstation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Beyond these distant working features, a whole panel of application publishing and network and server administration possibilities open up to TSplus Remote Access clients and users. Each added feature is carefully picked since we value simplicity and efficiency while still seeking to develop a comprehensive tool.</p>

<h2>TSplus Secure Remote Collaboration: Affordable, Simple, Connected, Anywhere!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Whether it is simply to enable home working, to maximise productivity in times of distant working, for easier administration of your infrastructure or to decrease the IT budget, TSplus Remote Access has just what it takes.</strong> <b> <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">Here</a> you can find more details about the product and its features and access downloads.

<h2>Are you monitoring your websites?</h2>
<strong>It is very important to monitor any website you may run. This is especially true if you are using them to make some extra cash, and definitely if a website is your only source of income. <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> is a tool you can use to help protect your websites from so many nasties which could affect your bottom line. Whether you want to generate visibility or income, website surveillance can make all the difference. Any of the following could bring a website to a close.</strong>
<h2>Monitoring your websites Against Hack Attacks</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If your website is hacked, it could be used for any number of illegal activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A hacker could use your hosting account to send UCE (Spam) from your domain or even add web pages such as user information "phishing" sites. These sites will have a page which looks like a login page for Paypal, eBay or any bank. If someone fills in the form, their details are sent to the hacker who then has access to their account. In this event, your website will be shut down. You risk losing money while you sort out the mess.</p>

<h2>Monitoring your Websites Against Non-Authorised Activity</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you have any user information stored on your websites server, a hacker may also gain access to that. Personal information is a very easy commodity to sell on and something that can do deep damage to individuals and businesses on a several levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important to keep an eye on your site for any unexpected activity or for unusual stats showing concerning pages you didn't make yourself. Most accounts have some kind of statistics built into the control panel so it shouldn't cost too much to monitor visits and hits and see to which pages they go.</p>

<h2>Monitor and Update your Websites</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also, make sure any scripts you use are secure and updated with any patches to keep the hackers out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>With <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">Tsplus Server Monitoring</a>, you can keep an eye on the up-time and down-time of your servers and websites. </strong>You can monitor percentages of usage and see how each is doing individually. This way, you can keep track of which needs closer attention or when traffic is fine.</p>

<h2>Monitoring Your Websites Against Hosting or Server Problems</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your host or server may have a problem, such as loss of access to the internet, or crashing. Theses sort of problems can take down with them all sites hosted there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This gives you two potential headaches, firstly loss of business while everything is offline, and secondly but more importantly potential loss of data. Making sure you take regular backups of all your databases and all your sites’ pages will help.</p>

<h2>Monitoring Your Websites Against Hosting Problems</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, monitoring how often any outages occur as well as how long each lasts will tell you whether it's time to change hosts. No host can guarantee with absolute certainty 100% uptime, but some are much more prone to downtime than others.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you have all the site information backed up, moving hosts isn't as much of a task as it used to be, so it can be done in quite a short time if needed.As hosting is such a cut-throat business, finding a new one is also relatively simple.</p>

<h2>Monitoring Your Websites and Servers with TSplus</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are even software programs which will alert you if your site is unavailable. <strong><a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a></strong> is one of these. You will receive alerts from the software while you run it and you can set notifications of various kinds which you or other specific people will receive. This is a great way to nip problems in the bud. You will often fix any trouble before clients even realise there was one.</p>

<h2>A Bit About Blog and Forum Spamming</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the all-pervasive spread of blogging, it was inevitable that some people would resort to spamming blog platforms. Forums and message boards are also open to abuse from software which will auto-post to thousands of sites in minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This field is not covered by TSplus software but is well worth knowing about if your business involves websites where commenting is possible.</p>

<h2>The Problems With Blog Spamming</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If your blog is able to accept comments, it is wise to ask for some kind of registration from people who wish to make comments. You should also be able to check comments before letting them be published. If you don't ask for registration or vet comment-posting, you leave your blog open to blatant advertising done by software. These will be unlikely to bear any relevance to your blogs subject, will discredit your blog pages and are likely to turn away people who would have been interested.</p>

<h2>The Problems With Forum Spamming</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This goes for your forums too. Allowing guests to post without registration is open to abuse by widely available software which auto-posts inane comments with a signature containing a URL to the spammers product. Even with registration activated you may find some users often known as “trolls” who register only to post negative, abusive or divisive comments and other irrelevant and inane messages.</p>

<h2>Benefits of User Registration for Websites</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Registration is a good solution, especially if you don’t have time to actually all comments to monitor and validate or refuse them. Asking for registration will help ensure that only people committed to posting something relevant get to add their comments or posts. If someone truly wants to post, they will take the time to register.</p>

<h2>Monitoring your websites</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It may take a little time but monitoring your websites could save you from a lot more wasted time in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Backups of your site will help and should be taken at least weekly. And all your scripts should at least have security updates as soon as they are released.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>It's your site, so make sure it stays in your control. <a href="https://tsplus.net/download/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> is here to make the job easier for you.

<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Computer-Security-for-Businesses-1024x576.png" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Computer-Security-for-Businesses-1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Computer-Security-for-Businesses-300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Computer-Security-for-Businesses-768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Computer-Security-for-Businesses-18x10.png 18w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Computer-Security-for-Businesses.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" width="800" height="450">								</a>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many businesses in the world today operate on networked systems that allow shared access to much information in order to streamline various processes. This is a wise decision by business owners as it saves a lot of time (and time is money in the world of business) that employees would otherwise spend waiting for various files to download onto their individual computer systems. <strong>The problem is that this can also present a security nightmare for many reasons. Let's look at a few of these and at the <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus</a> solution at hand.</strong></p>

<h2>Threats to Computer Security for Businesses: Viruses</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This could be the first reason to come to mind. Once one computer in the network is infected, it's a very slow business day, week, or month all around, plus in some cases an extremely expensive problem to fix. Many businesses have established policies in order to minimize these risks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What if your business does not have a security protocol in place for not only preventing viruses but also handling the aftermath of viruses? Then, it is time to talk with your IT department or contact an IT specialist from outside the company in order to establish protocols and procedures to combat the risks that viruses pose. Indeed, they can affect both productivity and the valuable information held within your companies computer systems.</p>

<h2>Boosts to Computer Security for Businesses: Systems Back-ups</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Regular computer systems back-ups! Here is an issue that many people do not consider when it comes to the security of computers for their businesses. However, stuff happens. Hard drives crash and servers die horrific yet spectacular deaths. The unfortunate truth is that these things never happen at opportune times (since there is never a good time for the computers of any business to go down).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The lag time however can be greatly reduced if a business creates daily backups of all computer systems. This can be done in a matter of minutes each day and can save months of highly expensive work trying to retrieve the information, should the unthinkable happen. It is well worth the costs and time involved to back up your computers each and every day as part of your company's security routine.</p>

<h2>Threat to IT Security for Businesses: Visitors</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most businesses have vendors and clients in and out all the time. Many of these visitors have laptop computers and need Internet access. Try to avoid allowing these visitors computers open access to the same information that your business gives to employees. Instead, it is best to have an external Internet source for visiting computers that is completely separate from the network shared by employees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It would be wonderful if we lived in a world in which we could trust visitors but the truth is we often can't. Not only are visitors not above sabotaging the competition, many are also not above trying to steal secrets, let alone the new product in the pipeline. For this reason, it is wise to invest in an internal network and an external network for your business.</p>

<h2>Hurdle to Computer Security for Businesses: Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is something that many companies offer employees as a way of allowing them to work from home on occasion during family emergencies and even after-hours. Many employees see this as a perk and more and more businesses are allowing this sort of access. The problem is that not all employees are as security conscious as they should be. You may be glad to know <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus</a> software is basically very secure software for Remote Work, Application publishing and so on, and that we have developed a great set of tools to make it even safer for your company and users.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Discuss with the IT experts in your company or those you consult how to minimize the risks involved in providing this 'perk' to employees. There are ways that can be incorporated which limit the information accessible to individual employees while they work remotely but still allow them to access the files that are relevant to their specific tasks and responsibilities via a password or code.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Find out how <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> can meet the security needs of your company and how to best implement it on your system.</strong></p>

<h2>TSplus Solution for Computer Security for Businesses</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The information age poses new risks for businesses at every turn in order to make up for the added conveniences. Be sure that your business takes the necessary steps to insure maximum security when it comes to the computers that make life so much easier.</p>

<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-Software-and-The-Business-of-The-Future-1024x576.png" alt="Banner with title of article, TSplus logo and link, illustrated by image of a laptop" loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-Software-and-The-Business-of-The-Future-1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-Software-and-The-Business-of-The-Future-300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-Software-and-The-Business-of-The-Future-768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-Software-and-The-Business-of-The-Future-18x10.png 18w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Remote-Software-and-The-Business-of-The-Future.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" width="800" height="450">								</a>

The Internet has combined with the evolution of corporate data, processes and communications to create the basis for a revolution in corporate organization. Businesses are becoming increasingly modular, doing what they do best and outsourcing the rest. The organization is increasingly turning toward project teams which can be assembled when necessary and dispersed when projects are completed.

To facilitate this, procedures, software and systems are being developed to control and support collaboration. <strong>Here's why <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> is software for the business of the future.</strong>
<h2>Remote Access for Businesses</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The result of these evolutions? New opportunities for remote workers and virtual offices. The new backdrop: leaner, task focused and ultimately a more efficient organization, with unlimited access to resources and personnel around the globe.</p>

<h2>The Office of the Future - Modern Business Calls for Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the heart of the new business organization is the virtual business or virtual office. The virtual business can span geographical boundaries and provide instant flexible collaboration. Thus, it can efficiently develop products and services with minimal supporting overhead. In this "office of the future", remote workers are linked in a dispersed infrastructure that is supported by software that supports and controls collaboration. Individuals share data and applications over a distance, transmit data of all types easily and efficiently.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also, without even leaving their homes, a work-group can meet up to exchange information and views using a variety of different techniques. These include videoconferencing, shared whiteboards, teleconferencing, instant messaging, and a variety of asynchronous correspondence and mail capabilities.</p>

<h2>Remote Software for Businesses</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Supporting the office of the future is a wide and growing range of collaborative software tools. They provide communications, project coordination, data sharing, and application access.  The base for this communication is, of course, the Internet, which has been speeding up as higher bandwidth technologies are rolled out. Broadband and Fibre are quicker than ever and enhance the opportunities for collaboration.</p>

<h2>Remote Access Software for Businesses: Always On, Anywhere, Anytime!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This openness and flexibility provides a number of advantages to both staff and business. In short:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<ul>
<strong>* Any time -</strong> flexible working hours, with improved scheduling for business, and more efficient performance from remote workers.
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>* Any place -</strong> flexible work location making it possible to employ people who work at home or in different parts of the country, or even across the globe.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>* Any competent task group -</strong> flexibility of project staffing, making it possible to make most efficient use of available personnel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>* Wider skill application -</strong> particular specialists may contribute to various projects rather than being dedicated to a single operation at one time in one place.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>* Amorphous organization -</strong> making it possible to create work-groups as needed to handle new projects or new support activities without the upheaval associated with different times and places.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>* Scalability and security -</strong> incorporating these characteristics in the modular systems and network infrastructure. Modules can be easily grown or combined, and security is integral to both policy and supporting IT infrastructure.</p>
</ul>
<h2>TSplus Remote Access Software for the Business of the Future</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">All of these need to be backed and enabled by the right software tools. TSplus Remote Access is one of a panel of <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus</a> products which make the office of the future a reality. Our range covers remote working, application publishing, screen sharing and support, monitoring farms, servers and websites and last but not least all-round security for these environments.</p>

<h2>Remote Access Software to Free Businesses</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Access puts at your fingertips application publishing so you can Web-enable your applications, whether they are the latest thing, legacy or a bit of both. It lets you create and manage a farm of servers. In addition, you can give access to your staff, users, clients, to the parts of your system which is relevant to them. You may be providing them with the tools to work remotely or giving them access to a highly specific item of software on their tablet from some backwater location at one of your remote plants.</p>

<h2>Remote Software Tools for Businesses</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Administrators can enable one user a particular range of software and another a completely different set, a full desktop of just one application. The whole of your teams can find their sessions will open in mere seconds thanks to Session Prelaunch which pre-loads user-sessions in advance of their usual login time.

Businesses are becoming increasingly modular, doing what they do best and outsourcing the rest. The organization is increasingly turning toward project teams which can be assembled when necessary and dispersed when projects are completed.<\/p>\n<p>To facilitate this, procedures, software and systems are being developed to control and support collaboration. <strong>Here's why <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/\">TSplus Remote Access<\/a> is software for the business of the future.<\/strong><\/p>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>Remote Access for Businesses<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The result of these evolutions? New opportunities for remote workers and virtual offices. The new backdrop: leaner, task focused and ultimately a more efficient organization, with unlimited access to resources and personnel around the globe.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Office of the Future - Modern Business Calls for Remote Access<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At the heart of the new business organization is the virtual business or virtual office. The virtual business can span geographical boundaries and provide instant flexible collaboration. Thus, it can efficiently develop products and services with minimal supporting overhead. In this \"office of the future\", remote workers are linked in a dispersed infrastructure that is supported by software that supports and controls collaboration. Individuals share data and applications over a distance, transmit data of all types easily and efficiently.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Also, without even leaving their homes, a work-group can meet up to exchange information and views using a variety of different techniques. These include videoconferencing, shared whiteboards, teleconferencing, instant messaging, and a variety of asynchronous correspondence and mail capabilities.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Remote Software for Businesses<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Supporting the office of the future is a wide and growing range of collaborative software tools. They provide communications, project coordination, data sharing, and application access.  The base for this communication is, of course, the Internet, which has been speeding up as higher bandwidth technologies are rolled out. Broadband and Fibre are quicker than ever and enhance the opportunities for collaboration.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Remote Access Software for Businesses: Always On, Anywhere, Anytime!<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This openness and flexibility provides a number of advantages to both staff and business. In short:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><ul>\n<strong>* Any time -<\/strong> flexible working hours, with improved scheduling for business, and more efficient performance from remote workers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>* Any place -<\/strong> flexible work location making it possible to employ people who work at home or in different parts of the country, or even across the globe.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>* Any competent task group -<\/strong> flexibility of project staffing, making it possible to make most efficient use of available personnel.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>* Wider skill application -<\/strong> particular specialists may contribute to various projects rather than being dedicated to a single operation at one time in one place.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>* Amorphous organization -<\/strong> making it possible to create work-groups as needed to handle new projects or new support activities without the upheaval associated with different times and places.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>* Scalability and security -<\/strong> incorporating these characteristics in the modular systems and network infrastructure. Modules can be easily grown or combined, and security is integral to both policy and supporting IT infrastructure. \n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n<h2>TSplus Remote Access Software for the Business of the Future<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">All of these need to be backed and enabled by the right software tools. TSplus Remote Access is one of a panel of <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">TSplus<\/a> products which make the office of the future a reality. Our range covers remote working, application publishing, screen sharing and support, monitoring farms, servers and websites and last but not least all-round security for these environments.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Remote Access Software to Free Businesses<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">TSplus Remote Access puts at your fingertips application publishing so you can Web-enable your applications, whether they are the latest thing, legacy or a bit of both. It lets you create and manage a farm of servers. In addition, you can give access to your staff, users, clients, to the parts of your system which is relevant to them. You may be providing them with the tools to work remotely or giving them access to a highly specific item of software on their tablet from some backwater location at one of your remote plants.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Remote Software Tools for Businesses<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Administrators can enable one user a particular range of software and another a completely different set, a full desktop of just one application. The whole of your teams can find their sessions will open in mere seconds thanks to Session Prelaunch which pre-loads user-sessions in advance of their usual login time. This speeds things up and helps make sure servers won\u2019t overload.<\/p>\n\n<h2>To Conclude<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The virtual organization supported by the right technologies is becoming an increasingly visible phenomenon.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> Can Ease Your Daily Commute!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Have you ever stopped to think how much time you waste commuting, or stuck in traffic? Wouldn't it be nice if there were a way to gain remote access to your office PC? Is there a way to work from home and still access your files at the office? For anyone who is away from the workplace on a regular basis, having the ability to access files can make a huge difference in productivity level. Find out how remote working can cut out travel time.</p>

<h2>Remote Working - an Instant Commute</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Access is the answer to easing your daily commute. It enables you to remotely work from anywhere, no commuting necessary. The software is installed on the corporate server only and requires simply opening your Web browser to access. It allows remote access from anywhere with an Internet connection.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What's more, security is no cause for concern. No wonder: firewalls and company protections can do their job as usual. Indeed, TSplus Remote Access is pre-configured for maximum security with TLS 1.2 end-to-end encryption. Additionally, using it through a web-browser requires no installation on the user’s part. Thus, because it works via HTML5, it is easily accessed.</p>

<h2>Remote Working - be More Competitive</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In today's highly competitive world, it is no secret that having more time to focus on the important tasks can give you a competitive advantage. Your job may require you to travel or you may have to work while you're on the road. Why spend time transferring files from your office PC to a portable storage device! Rather, use <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> for remote access to your office workstation. The time you would have taken planning what you will need and then transferring files (and hoping you remembered everything) can be better spent. Wherever you are and never mind how close or distant your remote location, you get straight to work, gaining an edge over the competition.</p>

<h2>Distant Working - be More Productive</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Do you often have to bring work home with you? Have you ever driven all the way home from your office only to discover you forgot to copy one of your computer files? With TSplus Remote Access, you will never again have to be concerned about forgetting to copy an important file. You will be able to access all the files on your work PC from any device with an Internet connection. What’s better, you will find your desktop exactly as you left when you left the office. Picking back up will be a matter of seconds. Like a laptop, but lighter.</p>

<h2>Work From Anywhere - be a Better Road Warrior</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Traveling salespeople and small business owners who travel around extensively understand that time is money! Maybe you are spending long hours each week on commuter trains or buses, possibly often standing in packed public transport? Why not make use of that otherwise wasted time and become a better road warrior? With TSplus Remote Access, you can log into your office PC from a wireless Internet enabled laptop, tablet or smartphone and get some work done while traveling. If you find yourself in hotels between meetings, you can use your <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> account to turn your travel time into productivity time.</p>

<h2>Work From Home and be Home More</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With remote access to your office computer, gone are the days of going into work early or staying late. Even if the long hours are unavoidable, there is no reason to do so when you can use TSplus Remote Access to open any of your important files on your home PC! Spend more time at home and less time commuting. Start later or get home earlier, according to your preferences or needs. Work a day or two per week from home. There are as many possibilities as users.</p>

<h2>TSplus Remote Access: User-Friendly, Affordable, Secure Way to an Easy Commute.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>You only need a Web browser to access all your programs, files, emails and network resources in real time, just as if you were at your desk! No extra software or hardware is needed, so why hesitate.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><b>TSplus Remote Access has a <a href="https://tsplus.net/download/">free trial</a> that will give you 15 days</b> to discover how remote access can increase your productivity, give you the competitive edge and help you be home more. <b>TSplus Remote Access is the simplest, most secure and best value-for-money way to access your PC from anywhere. What’s more, setup takes just 2 minutes to complete.</b></strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>How Does Multiple Server Hosting Impacts Your Websites’ Uptime?</h2>
<strong>This article describes the technology behind multiple server hosting and how you may utilize it to maximize your site's security and uptime. <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> is a tool for server and website surveillance designed with ergonomy, ease-of-use and simplicity in mind.</strong>
<h2>Multiple Servers for Website Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The hosting of web sites has essentially become a commodity. There is very little distinguishing one hosting company from the next. Core plans and features are the same and price is not always a true determining factor. In fact, choosing a host based on the cheapest price can work out more expensive in the long term with respect to reliability issues and possible loss of sales due to overall website downtime.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Selecting a host from the thousands of providers and resellers can be a very daunting task, which may result in a hit and miss approach. But although hosting may have become commonplace, one distinguishing feature that you must always look for is reliability.</p>

<h2>Reliability of Hosting for Website Uptime</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the heart of any hosting company's reliability is redundancy. This ensures that if a problem exists at one point, there will be an alternative which ensures continuity as seamlessly and transparently as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most hosts employ redundant network connections. These are the high-speed pipes that route data from the server to your web browser. But, redundant 'multiple web servers' have been extremely rare and very expensive, requiring costly routing equipment which has previously been used only in mission critical applications of Fortune 500 companies.</p>

<h2>Special DNS feature for Reliability and Website Uptime</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, a very neat but little-known Domain Name Server (DNS) feature called 'round robin' allows the selection and provision of a particular IP address from a 'pool' of addresses when a DNS request arrives.</p>

<h2>What is an IP address?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To understand what this has to do with server reliability, it's important to remember that the DNS database maps a host name to their IP address. So instead of using a hard to remember series of numbers (IP address), we just type in your web browser www.yourdomain.com, to get to your website.</p>

<h2>Of the importance of DNS for Website Uptime!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, typically it takes at least 2 to 3 days to propagate or ‘spread the word’ of your DNS info throughout the internet. That's why, when you register or transfer a domain name, it isn't immediately available to people browsing the web.</p>

<h2>DNS Delays in Multiple Web Server Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This propagation delay has stymied the security benefits of hosting your site on multiple servers. Indeed, your site would be down for a couple of days if something went awry with one server. You would have to change your DNS to reflect your second server and wait days before the change was picked up in routers on the internet. (Please note there is no mention here of potential delay in noticing the failure of the original server.)</p>

<h2>The DNS Strategy for Reliable Multiple Server Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, the round robin DNS strategy solves this predicament, by mapping your domain name to more than one IP address, thus cutting out the propagation delays.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Select hosting companies now employ the DNS round robin technique in conjunction with 'failover monitoring'.</p>

<h2>Website Uptime thanks to Multiple Web Server Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The DNS round robin failover monitoring process starts by a web hosting company setting up your site on two or more independent web servers (preferably with different IP blocks assigned to them). Your domain name will therefore have 2 or more IP Addresses assigned to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then the failover monitor watches your web server(s) by dispatching data to a URL you specify and looking for particular text in the results. When the system detects that one of your IP addresses is returning an error, and the others aren't, it pulls that IP address out of the list. The DNS then points your domain name to the working IP address or addresses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If any of your IP's come back online, they are restored to the IP pool. This effectively and safely keeps your site online – even if one of your web servers goes down.</p>

<h2>Minimum Detection Delays and Server &amp; Website Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The average failure detection and recovery time with a system like this can be as low as 15 minutes. This time varies depending on the speed of your site and the nature of the failure and also how long other ISP's cache (save) your DNS information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, you must bear in mind the matter of how frequently data is synchronized between your website's servers. If you have chosen a hosting company, this will be their responsibility, and things may become complicated where databases and user sessions are involved.</p>

<h2>Monitoring your multiple Servers and Websites for Uptime</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The very expensive hardware-based failover monitoring systems that point a virtual IP address to other ISP's, while behind the scenes juggling a number of unique IP addresses on different servers, is of course the most 'elegant' solution to multi server hosting.That way, the whole issue of ISP's caching your information does not come into play.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>This is where <b><a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a></b> will work its magic. You can keep a close eye on various aspects of your servers and websites, their uptime, downtime, usage, etc., so you will know instantly if anything is down.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What's more, via our software's user-friendly console, you can set up alerts for any items and thresholds you choose, and receive these via email or Teams. This keeps you and your team informed, wherever you are and whenever events take place.</p>

<h2>TSplus Server Monitoring to ensure Website Uptime</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Therefore, for sites that need to have true 99.99995% uptime, without huge outlays of money, the technology is readily available. TSplus Server Monitoring will go a long way towards ensuringyour websites run smoothly. certain proprietary failure monitoring systems are now relatively cheap to apply.</p>

<h2>Monitoring your websites</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The time taken for other ISP's caching yoISP's will use to determine how long to cache your DNS information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Backups of your site will help and should be taken at least weekly. And all your scripts should at least have security updates as soon as they are released.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>It's your site, so make sure it stays in your control. <a href="https://tsplus.net/download/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> is here to make the job easier for you.

But although hosting may have become commonplace, one distinguishing feature that you must always look for is reliability.<\/p><h2>Reliability of Hosting for Website Uptime<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">At the heart of any hosting company's reliability is redundancy. This ensures that if a problem exists at one point, there will be an alternative which ensures continuity as seamlessly and transparently as possible.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most hosts employ redundant network connections. These are the high-speed pipes that route data from the server to your web browser. But, redundant 'multiple web servers' have been extremely rare and very expensive, requiring costly routing equipment which has previously been used only in mission critical applications of Fortune 500 companies.<\/p><h2>Special DNS feature for Reliability and Website Uptime<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, a very neat but little-known Domain Name Server (DNS) feature called 'round robin' allows the selection and provision of a particular IP address from a 'pool' of addresses when a DNS request arrives.<\/p><h2>What is an IP address?<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">To understand what this has to do with server reliability, it's important to remember that the DNS database maps a host name to their IP address. So instead of using a hard to remember series of numbers (IP address), we just type in your web browser www.yourdomain.com, to get to your website.<\/p><h2>Of the importance of DNS for Website Uptime!<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now, typically it takes at least 2 to 3 days to propagate or \u2018spread the word\u2019 of your DNS info throughout the internet. That's why, when you register or transfer a domain name, it isn't immediately available to people browsing the web.<\/p><h2>DNS Delays in Multiple Web Server Hosting<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This propagation delay has stymied the security benefits of hosting your site on multiple servers. Indeed, your site would be down for a couple of days if something went awry with one server. You would have to change your DNS to reflect your second server and wait days before the change was picked up in routers on the internet. (Please note there is no mention here of potential delay in noticing the failure of the original server.)<\/p><h2>The DNS Strategy for Reliable Multiple Server Hosting<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, the round robin DNS strategy solves this predicament, by mapping your domain name to more than one IP address, thus cutting out the propagation delays.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Select hosting companies now employ the DNS round robin technique in conjunction with 'failover monitoring'.<\/p><h2>Website Uptime thanks to Multiple Web Server Hosting<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The DNS round robin failover monitoring process starts by a web hosting company setting up your site on two or more independent web servers (preferably with different IP blocks assigned to them). Your domain name will therefore have 2 or more IP Addresses assigned to it.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Then the failover monitor watches your web server(s) by dispatching data to a URL you specify and looking for particular text in the results. When the system detects that one of your IP addresses is returning an error, and the others aren't, it pulls that IP address out of the list. The DNS then points your domain name to the working IP address or addresses.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If any of your IP's come back online, they are restored to the IP pool. This effectively and safely keeps your site online \u2013 even if one of your web servers goes down.<\/p><h2>Minimum Detection Delays and Server &amp; Website Monitoring<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The average failure detection and recovery time with a system like this can be as low as 15 minutes. This time varies depending on the speed of your site and the nature of the failure and also how long other ISP's cache (save) your DNS information.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, you must bear in mind the matter of how frequently data is synchronized between your website's servers. If you have chosen a hosting company, this will be their responsibility, and things may become complicated where databases and user sessions are involved.<\/p><h2>Monitoring your multiple Servers and Websites for Uptime<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The very expensive hardware-based failover monitoring systems that point a virtual IP address to other ISP's, while behind the scenes juggling a number of unique IP addresses on different servers, is of course the most 'elegant' solution to multi server hosting.That way, the whole issue of ISP's caching your information does not come into play.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>This is where <b><a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/server-monitoring\/\">TSplus Server Monitoring<\/a><\/b> will work its magic. You can keep a close eye on various aspects of your servers and websites, their uptime, downtime, usage, etc., so you will know instantly if anything is down.<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What's more, via our software's user-friendly console, you can set up alerts for any items and thresholds you choose, and receive these via email or Teams.

TSplus Server Monitoring will go a long way towards ensuringyour websites run smoothly. certain proprietary failure monitoring systems are now relatively cheap to apply.<\/p><h2>Monitoring your websites<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The time taken for other ISP's caching yoISP's will use to determine how long to cache your DNS information.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Backups of your site will help and should be taken at least weekly. And all your scripts should at least have security updates as soon as they are released.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>It's your site, so make sure it stays in your control. <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/download\/\">TSplus Server Monitoring<\/a> is here to make the job easier for you.

<strong>Studies show that large numbers of people have computers and other IT devices in their homes. More and more workers are also working from home or on the road.</strong> Through the height of the pandemic, remote access and web conferencing software enabled work and professional collaboration among co-workers and clients in spite of all the lock-downs. Now companies and workers make more frequent use than ever of the potential of software such as<strong> <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a></strong> for enabling teamwork regardless of geographical distance.
<h2>Remote Access Software! A Whole Range of Potential</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote access and web publication software enables document, file, application and even desktop sharing. Web conferencing software is great for letting teams get together without having to come to the office or even be in the same town or country. Some types of remote software can be used downloaded or simply accessed via a URL, using a password or access code to connect. All these ways of remotely accessing workstations and applications lessen the company outlay on travel as well as the time and effort invested on travelling.</p>

<h2>From RDP to Remote Assistance</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to Remote Desktop Protocol, accessing a device remotely and controlling it to update or fix it can be done in real time over the Internet. Desktop sharing is one of the most important feature for remote support. It enhances the ability to solve issues, show steps to follow and generally troubleshoot without needing to visit the colleague or customer. A remote support team can be dotted around the globe and still do its job to a T. They may indeed be able to carry out better interventions due to a wider availability around the clock. Indeed, members from the other side of the planet can be reactive and give assistance while it is night-time locally due to the time difference.</p>

<h2>Safe Remote Assistance from Anywhere</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a>, workers can access a session from any device that has an Internet connection, including home computers and laptops, but also tablets and smartphones. It becomes easy to provide assistance at any time, from any place. The data shared amounts to images rather than the actual applications or data on which the agent is working. That way, company data remains safe behind the company firewall, while end-to-end encryption makes sure that what does travel goes safely wherever it travels.</p>

<h2>Quick &amp; Easy Remote Assistance Screen Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Support login or control is possible easily and rapidly. With other remote login or control software, it is often necessary to have a downloaded software for the sharing and secure desktop connection. This is no obligation with TSplus. To share a screen, the host computer allows a remote user to view the contents of their “host” computer desktop and take control of it. All of this takes place via one brief exchange of credentials.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The host computer can also hand over the control of the mouse and keyboard to the remote user. Handing off the control will enable the remote user to manipulate the mouse and keyboard of the host computer.</p>

<h2>Remote Assistance and Support Over Any Bandwidth</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to the bandwidth of their connection, users can choose higher or lower resolution for the screen share. This feature permits less detailed video streaming data to be sent over lower bandwidth connection. Agents still efficiently carry out the job without being hampered by the fact that not all Internet connections are strong, fast and ideal. And where the connection is at its best, all users can enjoy high-definition visuals and rapid, reactive responses of their devices.</p>

<h2>User-Friendly Remote Support and Assistance</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Desktop sharing has been frequently used by technical support representatives to trouble shoot technical and software problems without physically visiting the clients.  Desktop sharing provides a better customer experience.  Complications brought about by providing too many instructions over the phone are lessened by remote login and access.</p>

<h2>Multi-Agent Access in Remote Assistance Sessions</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to TSplus Remote Support one agent can assist different users without either party downloading or installing extra copies of the application. If need be, additional agents can be invited into the session. Examples of this would be for teamwork, for observation of for training purposes.</p>

<h2>Remote Assistance and Collaboration</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Support desktop sharing can also bring users one step closer in enhancing their collaboration, cooperation and productiveness.  If an employee is sent to another location to conduct seminars or to do a very important presentation, this employee may contact his co-workers and ask for their opinion about his presentation.  Via Remote Support, co-workers can do more than just visualise their colleague’s presentation or computer. They can provide practical input about the presentation without physically going to visit the employee who is away. Together, they can directly make any improvements they may suggest without a shadow of a doubt concerning which item they are each pinpointing. In addition, host and agent can upload documents they may want to exchange.</p>

<h2>To Conclude on Remote Assistance</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Through desktop sharing, application publishing, web conferencing and such software, professional and working relationships are improved and enriched. Conducive and productive working atmosphere is developed inside and outside the workplace. Possibilities depend on inventiveness and inspiration. Most of these tools make life easier daily for many users around the globe.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Spyware: A Threat That Won’t Go Away</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As spyware threats continue to grow, the methods by which users are infected becomes less and less difficult. It no longer takes obtaining physical access to a computer nor do users have to click on an ad or email attachment to cause the installation of a malicious application. Spyware and ransomware can easily be picked up by simply visiting a web site. It finds its way onto computers commonly when users download freeware or shareware. When you download these programs, spyware and adware are frequently installed invisibly. Thankfully, <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> is at hand.</p>

<h2>Signs of a Spyware Infection and What is Threatened</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may begin to notice more pop ups and slower computer functions once spyware has infected your system. Spyware moves through your computer and monitors your internet habits, then the information is sent to a third party. This third party will most likely use it for advertising purposes. More serious types of spyware are capable of recording each keystroke you make on your computer. This means every chat or email message as well as passwords, social security and credit card number are all recorded by the intruder. These gather what they need to access accounts and worse steal money and even identities.</p>

<h2>Some Types of Spyware and Cyber Threats</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Being aware of threats means you can be more careful and better prepared. Several different types exist: spyware, ransomware and so on, which makes catching and removing the invasive applications even more difficult.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Adware is one of the most common forms of cyber threat. It works by sending you pop-up ad after pop-up ad for various products and services while you are online. Adware also monitors your internet surfing habits and sells that information to other parties who then use it to bombard you with junk emails and spam.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another form of attack comes as browser hijackers. These applications can get into your computer and change your start page and preferred search engine to a site full of ads or adult material. Browser hijackers are typically also data miners which report all of your internet browsing habits to a central database that is sold to other parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the most dangerous and malicious type of programs is keyloggers, which are used mostly for identity theft and credit card fraud. Keyloggers can record every piece of information you type in your computer from credit card numbers to social security numbers and banking information. These do the most damage financially and are amongst the worst causes of identity theft.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, a costly form of spyware that users have to deal with is the modem hijacker. Also known as dialers, these applications install themselves so they can use your internet connection to dial long distance or premium rate phone numbers. By unknowingly dialing these remote areas from your Internet connexion, you are the one charged for the outrageous rates.</p>

<h2>Fending Off Spyware and Other Cyber Threats</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are yet other types of cyber-threats, but those cover a wide enough range for this time. When a cyber attack takes place on your system, you need to be able to stop it in its tracks and root it out. To remove any current spyware infections, users need to obtain anti-spyware programs. These programs can scan your system, compile a list of infected files and remove them to restore normal setting and functioning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, there are some very decent free spyware tools, some of which work well together in catching all possible spyware infections, but these are rarely scalable for businesses, let alone larger companies. <strong>At this stage, <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> will take its first amazing step towards making your system secure:</strong> it will quarantine and curtail the action of any spyware. It can even notice it before it comes into action due to its silent learning time by which it will increasingly differentiate the usual users from unknown exterior visits.</p>

<h2>Watching Out For Potential Sources of Spyware and Other Cyber Threats</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To avoid future spyware threats from infecting your computer, do not click on links or ads offering free movies, competitions, prizes, etc.. Also, very importantly, to download software, choose your sources with great care, making sure a site is trustworthy and that you are on the real website, and not a fake. Indeed, one of the things to watch out for are links and websites which are made to look similar to big names. Typing errors in the URL can be a give-away that the site is a malicious copy. On paying closer attention, you may notice small insidious differences that can be missed when going too fast or not reading them precisely. This is a means malicious persons often use to mislead users onto their malware, spyware and other attacks. As <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> blocks a seemingly endless list of known malicious IPs, a good number of these threats will be thwarted before they happen.</p>

<h2>A firewall to Help Keep You PC Safer</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Installing and keeping a firewall activated on your computer can help reduce the amount of cyber-infections. And having a good anti-virus program is essential, although it cannot detect most forms of spyware it will help keep your computer more secure. A fine place to start is with a PC's in-built Windows Defender. Tsplus Advanced Security will be the only other protection your system will need.</p>

<h2>Stay Safe from Cyber Threats with Efficient Protection</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Advanced Security is a solid 360° protection against most threats that can assail your IT devices. It affords full protection against malicious sites with millions of know IPs blocked. That is just one of the amazing security features which make up TSplus Advanced Security.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other features are Homeland Protection, for blocking countries from which you don’t connect, Working Hours, to restrict hours when users can login according to their use, IP whitelisting, Bruteforce Defender which protects against brute-force robots, hackers and network scanners, Ransomeware Protection, Permissions, Endpoint Protection and Secure Desktop. All of these security tools are set in a well-thought-out admin console. It has some great monitoring features and a Lite Mode which hides the most technical aspects for an even simpler user experience.</p>

		<p><strong>In enterprise networks, awareness of performance problems can come from different sources. Many messages will come from a monitoring tool but sometimes they can come in the form of complaints and comments from users. These different sources will nonetheless point to different types of issues. They can also improve coherence and corporate cohesion between teams.</strong></p><h2>Monitoring with tools such as TSPlus Server Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Monitoring tool notifications are a great asset. With all the potential problems that can occur on a network, especially as the size goes up, monitoring is a basic that can’t be passed upon. Now, such tools have a focus on "server down, switch down" alerts and not all look for the other, far more subtle, signs that can pinpoint a problem. With <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a>, you can keep track of your websites, applications, severs and also users presence, all from one console.</p>
<h2>User Experience for Network Improvement</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Business user complaints and comments are tangible and frequently high profile. They usually involve the Business User engagement. Such problems end up being discussed in management meetings and must be addressed quickly as well as successfully. They must be addressed even if there are no alerts from your monitoring system. After all, the automatic alerts (if they triggered at all) are not really focused on the "user experience". When a human being is having trouble performing their job, with all that entails including feeding their family, they do not want to hear statistics, however genuine their count.</p>
<h2>Combined Approach to Network Assessment</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A standard network assessment is usually a review of network architecture. It may concern bandwidth utilisation and errors, up and down time, user presence, application use peak-times, and much more. On the other hand, there are staff, clients, other business users. Each will see &amp; feel how the server or application itself uses the network. Their daily use can rapidly make them aware of how it actually “surfs” your network, be it local or Web-based. This first-hand information can be just as important to act upon as standard monitoring tool alerts.</p>
<h2>Tools for a Combined Application &amp; Protocol Behaviour Feedback Approach to Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The second, person-centred information, will come via whatever communication a company chooses to put in place. The first, device-centred information, will need a good monitoring tool such as TSplus Server Monitoring. Software which can keep your IT team au-fait where two main performance and usage pools are concerned: that of all corporate servers and websites, without forgetting application usage and user presence.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately, this perspective gets minimal attention in a standard network assessment processes. The combined assessment methodology provides a two-pronged approach which can be more interesting though more complicated to implement.</p>
<h2>Potential of Combining Machine and Human Feedback</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This means IT agents or assessors can simultaneously evaluate and manage: network architecture, bandwidth utilization, network errors, and...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep track of some of the following:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>* Watch the critical applications themselves utilize the network (from the packet level).</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>* Use tools such as Sniffer / Ethereal / WireShark as well as many other proprietary and open-source tools.</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>* Identify all delays regardless of their source (Network, Application, Servers, Database, OS, etc.).</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>* Quantify this data to the byte and the microsecond.</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>* Compare these results to the data from our Network Architecture Assessment.</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>* Review Interpaths for applications -- from Switch Port to Switch Port -- Router to Router.</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>* Evaluate Network Protocol behaviour regarding Network Transport times, TCP tuning.</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>* And more.</ul></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This two-pronged approach captures the actual way applications behave on the network from multiple locations and then compares it to the network architecture. Conjointly, these two angles of work combine to provide clear understanding of the causes of the problems and provide a path for resolution.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Combined Network Testing</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are some great advantages to this:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- It is a “department-neutral” approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- It does not assume the problem is network based, although it does analyse the network.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- It does not assume the problem is with the server or application, although the application’s network behaviour is measured.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All results are quantified and objective. They allow departments to come together from their own standpoints towards a same point of view, thus resolving the technical problem as well as the political one.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In many cases, the problem is one of balance. Neither the network or application or any other single source is the cause of some problems. If you are only looking from the perspective of application support or network support, you may miss discovering issues that span multiple areas of responsibility.</p>
<h2>Bringing Support Teams and Users Together for Network Improvement</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This assessment methodology will uncover the truth regardless of the cause of the problems. It is then possible to fix some issues directly. Of course, some problems may require to diplomatically provide detailed documentation and guidance (if requested) to map out a path towards resolution.</p>
<h2>TSplus Server Monitoring for User-Friendly Network Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Server Monitoring keeps track of your Servers, Websites, Applications and more from one user-friendly console. It also has a host of customisable features to simplify the surveillance of your network and to bring fluidity to the process via better and instant information. You can focus in on particular servers, websites etc. and configure email and other alerts to be sent out, all this depending on your preferences and needs.</p>

<strong>Be it a simple application freeze, an unresponsive desktop or a white screen, there probably aren’t many people around the globe who haven’t experienced some kind of trouble whilst using a computer. And the more you use computer devices, the higher the chance of you knowing the feeling of frustration and despair that can go with such events. Some fixes are simple, while others require assistance.</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">In dire times, enter the IT support agents, some of them savvily armed with <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a>, and everything should get better soon. If you’re one for DIY before calling for help, here are a few essentials to try when a machine lets you down. And you can deal with your own or anyone else's anywhere thanks to our remote-control software.</p>

<h2>Where to Start With Computer Issues</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are a few places to start when troubleshooting. Let me name “Ctrl+Alt+Del”, which will open Task Manager on most Windows machines, “Restart” or “the off-switch” depending how frozen everything is, and finally, checking all “cables” are well connected.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It’s always worth making sure the basics are in good order. Indeed, a printer has no chance of communicating without its cable being plugged in properly.</p>

<h2>Documenting the Troubleshooting Steps</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before you start, you might want to keep in mind that it’s always good to take notes of the steps you’ve taken. Two good reasons for this are: future fixes on a similar problem and asking for help when all else has failed. So, remember to jot things down, take screen captures of error messages, etc. so you can refer to all that as needed.</p>

<h2>Where to Begin Troubleshooting Windows</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, it doesn’t matter whether you are bailing someone out remotely via TSplus Remote Support or whether you are fixing something on your own device. Here are a few ideas of troubleshooting solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">An all-time favourite has to remain the program manager, generally brought up by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del on just about any Windows device. This shortcut will open Program Manager or Task Manager, which allows you to monitor and potentially close applications. This will generally stop the faulty process causing the freeze. However, you can also download one of many task manager utilities from the Web.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Windows – Restarting and Updating</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It may be the freeze or problem is light enough that you can directly relaunch the faulty application. Or you may be able to close it and update it. Indeed, some applications are sluggish when an update is needed. If that’s all the problem is, no need to look any further.</p>

<h2>A Process? Which Process?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Processes tab displays a comprehensive list of all the processes currently running on your computer. This can be very useful for monitoring your system. It displays information about the processor and memory usage of each process.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The question you might ask is: how to identify a process? There are whole lists of processes which you may see in your Task Manager’s processes list. These are usually those files ending in .exe. An example: "System Idle Process" is basically another name for the time when Windows is doing nothing. There are hundreds of thousands of processes that run on a computer. For a list of well-known processes, a Web search is your best port of call. You can do a general search or learn about individual tasks by using each name as the search term.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting via Task Manager – CPU and Memory Usage</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">While you’re there, Task Manager can also be used to tweak your system if it's running slow. The Performance tab displays running graphs of your computer’s CPU and memory usage. In the Process tab, you can identify processes that are consuming a lot of processor time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can perform these fixes from a distance using <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/features/">TSplus Remote Support</a>. Features include screen sharing and control, multi-monitor and multi-monitor, live chat and unattended features.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If the CPU usage seems to be running over 80 percent most of the time, or if the memory usage seems to be running higher than the total physical memory, you may want to shut down some applications or processes. You could click twice on the CPU column heading to sort it so the processes using the most CPU time appear at the top. You can sort the "Memory Usage" column the same way.</p>

<h2>Managing Usage via Task Manager – Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the Application tab, if you right click on the name of an application and, in the popup menu that appears, choose "Go To Process", Task Manager will open the Processes tab and highlight the process that runs the application. On the Processes tab, if you right-click on the name of a process, you can choose "Set Priority" and promote the priority of the process you need (or demote the priority of a different process to free up some resources).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you go to the Application tab and shut down an application, you will shut down any processes related to that application. Or you might choose to shut down a background process that you can identify. To shut down an application or process, click on its name in the list to highlight it, then click on the End Task button. You can even choose "End Process Tree" to kill the process along with any sub-processes started by the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This sort of work is great prevention, whether you are servicing your own machine or working on distant devices. It should save users from potential freezes and troubles.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting via Task Manager – Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Task Manager can also be used for troubleshooting. If an application freezes up, you can open Task Manager and shut down the application. If the entire system freezes up, you can use Task Manager to shut down a process that is hogging all the CPU time or memory.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you spend some time monitoring your computer or server with task Manager, eventually you will become familiar with the processes that commonly run. Then, when you see an unfamiliar process, you can easily do a little investigation to make sure it's not a virus. For example, if you see msblast.exe in the process list, your computer is infected with the Blaster virus. Through regular monitoring, you might be able to detect and eliminate a new virus before an antivirus update is available. Though that doesn't meant you should leave your devices without cyber-protection.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting via Trial and Error</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">That’s actually the way most troubleshooting takes place. Restarting, closing, updating, pushing back or forth in the CPU and memory usage priority lists, all of these amount to trial and error. Most of an agent’s work will be slowed down or accelerated according to the order in which they try the various solutions and apply any given fix. That said, here are another couple of things to try before going in deep and trying to fix things at system-level. Though, you might find our cyber-security software <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> can step in too, for instance saving you work and worry in the following two areas.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting by Removing Unwanted Programs</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is worth looking through the list of applications in your devices once in a while. Should you spot any software which you don’t remember downloading or installing, it could be unwanted and even malicious. The best thing to do with unwanted software is simply uninstall it. You or your client may no-longer need it, or it may be a stowaway, no matter. The uninstall button is the sensible path to follow.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting by Scanning for Malware</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">And last but not least, you may want to scan the troubled machine for malware. Sluggishness and hampered processes can easily be a sign of the presence of malware. Do pay heed to such signs and check for malware so you can nip the problem in the bud. As malware can mean quarantining a section, set of files or more, the quicker it is spotted and stopped, the better.</p>

<h2>To Conclude on Troubleshooting Windows</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>By no means exhaustive, this is a starter-list of places to look for causes of computer trouble you may have to solve. And if you want to work on devices from a distance, <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> is the tool for the job.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In the late 2010s, flexible work arrangements were already on the rise, if slowly. 2020 supercharged that with the pandemic creating a mass exodus of workers from the corporate office to the home office. Remote working became the word of the day. But the question from the beginning was often 'What happens next?'. Well, how about keeping <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">remote work</a> - hybrid working solutions are here to stay!</p>

<h2>Hybrid Working as a Solution</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">For a lot of companies, that question was answered with hybrid working at the time of all the lock-downs. But while certain companies embraced the new trend, others went there under duress and jumped straight back out as soon as they could. Nonetheless, a few days in the office, balanced by a few days working from home each week, has become a new norm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This offers employees the flexibility they have come to expect, while keeping the in-person vibe so crucial to cohesion of working teams. Hybrid working presents its own challenges. Yet, it also offers unique opportunities for day-to-day concerns ranging from staffing to data security and integrity.</p>

<h2>Hybrid Working Solutions to Reconcile Companies with Remote Work</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">When many companies scattered their staff to the safety of the home office. That left thousands of empty offices and millions of unattended workstations sitting idle. The added cost of mobile devices and supplies for remote workers was too much for some. It was often impractical to bear another large expenditure to accommodate yet another evolution of working conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With businesses and corporations alike still struggling to balance all these variables, one solution has risen to the top – <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a>.</p>

<h2>Remote Work Without Heavy Investment</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Access offers the simple and secure way to maximize the existing infrastructure of a corporate office. All that while integrating the concepts of remote work. Yet, still without introducing extra significant overheads in either IT time or cost.</p>

<h2>Remote Work &amp; Data and Devices</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">When workers are in the office, all those workstations that were dormant during the various lock-downs, come to life again in service to their company. With TSplus Remote Access, these devices do not stay idle either. Remote workers now find themselves balancing software, documents, and other files between 2 or more computers, depending on where they are working that day.</p>

<h2>Remote Working by TSplus - Keeping Data Safe</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Access eases security concerns by creating a web access gateway. This enables each user to access their office desktop while staying behind the company firewall and protections. Users can work from the office without transporting sensitive documents or other corporate information on their laptops. Their data can remain safely in the office while they work from anywhere with an Internet connection.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And if secure communications over HTML5, accessible only with correct credentials, isn't enough, no worries. TSplus makes 2FA available for added peace of mind, whether workers are in the office or working remotely.</p>

<h2>Remote Working with TSplus Remote Access: a Solution for Hybrid Working</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>TSplus Remote Access servers can be hosted directly in the office. How better to give direct and discrete access for each user to connect directly to their desktop?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The setup is simple and doesn't require advanced technical skills. Nonetheless, our quick-start guides and user documentation are carefully written to enable smooth setup. To make it even easier to consider, TSplus Remote Access licensing is priced with tight IT budgets in mind – and the licensing is permanent. That way the solution is yours and causes no recurring monthly bills.</strong></p>

<b>In the first quarter of 2020, corporate life, and how we look at office staffing, changed – maybe forever.</b>

As businesses scrambled to find remote working solutions, the market-leaders raked in the sudden (necessary) bump in everyone's IT budget. Millions of dollars were spent on complex solutions with the goal of getting results NOW, without much concern for long-term viability. After all, the lockdowns were temporary. Afterwards everything would just go back to normal, right?
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Wrong.</b></p>

<h2>Remote Access for a New Way to Work</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">After 2 years of intermittent staffing challenges, businesses are beginning to recognize the following fact: the "normal" we had is not the "normal" we will have going forward. Especially among skilled workers, the idea of hours-long commutes and office cubicles is no longer widely accepted.</p>

<h2>Remote Access: Nothing in Excess of What is Necessary</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Along with this is the recognition that many of the emergency measures taken in the past 2 years are not practical long-term solutions for many reasons. The big names that offer scalability are quite expensive. They often include numerous functionalities that are not useful to a majority of people. In short, they require you to pay exorbitant fees for things you’ll likely never use. Just to get the minimum functionality your organization needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enter <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus</a> – a class leader in scalable, secure remote working solutions designed to be exactly the practical long-term solution companies need. With its combination of flexibility, simple administration, security and business-friendly pricing, TSplus Remote Access was created specifically to deal with this hole in the market.</p>

<h2>Flexibility for Remote Working, Long Term</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote Access offers levels of service that can appeal to the budget of the smallest 1-man shop, or an established and growing corporation. A combination of scalability, offerings based on feature-sets, and amazing technical support.</p>

<h2>Simple Administration for Long Term Remote Work</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tsplus Remote Access was built on the idea that managing a remote infrastructure should not take a dedicated team of geniuses just to get it up and running. Installation is quick and basic configuration requires little advanced technical skill. As things scale up, the complexity and inter-operation with classic Windows server administration keeps operations both robust and as simple as possible.</p>

<h2>Security - Keeping Remote Working Safe</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With built-in security features like lock-out, Remote Access provides the first floor of security. Using tools like TSplus Two Factor Authentication, and TSplus Advanced Security, your administration worries go down and your automated security strength is greatly increased.</p>

<h2>Low Overhead for Efficient Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Saving the best for last, business-friendly pricing is at the root of all TSplus products. Many of the core staff at TSplus have spent their lives in IT and have seen the budgets needed to operate infrastructures of different sizes. Knowing that it doesn’t have to be this way, the TSplus team often approaches new product discussions from the central question: ‘How can this help small businesses?’. Reach that goal and scale up from there.</p>

<h2>To Conclude on Remote Access for Remote Working Long-Term</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Remote Access is the ideal alternative to RDS and Citrix workspace. <b>Secure Remote Working, without breaking the bank.</b> Download the 5-user, 15-day free trial today and see how your own business can benefit from <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a>.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

Millions of dollars were spent on complex solutions with the goal of getting results NOW, without much concern for long-term viability. After all, the lockdowns were temporary. Afterwards everything would just go back to normal, right?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Wrong.<\/b><\/p>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>Remote Access for a New Way to Work<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After 2 years of intermittent staffing challenges, businesses are beginning to recognize the following fact: the \"normal\" we had is not the \"normal\" we will have going forward. Especially among skilled workers, the idea of hours-long commutes and office cubicles is no longer widely accepted.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Remote Access: Nothing in Excess of What is Necessary<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Along with this is the recognition that many of the emergency measures taken in the past 2 years are not practical long-term solutions for many reasons. The big names that offer scalability are quite expensive. They often include numerous functionalities that are not useful to a majority of people. In short, they require you to pay exorbitant fees for things you\u2019ll likely never use. Just to get the minimum functionality your organization needs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Enter <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">TSplus<\/a> \u2013 a class leader in scalable, secure remote working solutions designed to be exactly the practical long-term solution companies need. With its combination of flexibility, simple administration, security and business-friendly pricing, TSplus Remote Access was created specifically to deal with this hole in the market.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Flexibility for Remote Working, Long Term<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Remote Access offers levels of service that can appeal to the budget of the smallest 1-man shop, or an established and growing corporation. A combination of scalability, offerings based on feature-sets, and amazing technical support.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Simple Administration for Long Term Remote Work<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tsplus Remote Access was built on the idea that managing a remote infrastructure should not take a dedicated team of geniuses just to get it up and running. Installation is quick and basic configuration requires little advanced technical skill. As things scale up, the complexity and inter-operation with classic Windows server administration keeps operations both robust and as simple as possible.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Security - Keeping Remote Working Safe<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With built-in security features like lock-out, Remote Access provides the first floor of security. Using tools like TSplus Two Factor Authentication, and TSplus Advanced Security, your administration worries go down and your automated security strength is greatly increased.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Low Overhead for Efficient Remote Access<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Saving the best for last, business-friendly pricing is at the root of all TSplus products. Many of the core staff at TSplus have spent their lives in IT and have seen the budgets needed to operate infrastructures of different sizes. Knowing that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way, the TSplus team often approaches new product discussions from the central question: \u2018How can this help small businesses?\u2019. Reach that goal and scale up from there.<\/p>\n\n<h2>To Conclude on Remote Access for Remote Working Long-Term<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Remote Access is the ideal alternative to RDS and Citrix workspace. <b>Secure Remote Working, without breaking the bank.<\/b> Download the 5-user, 15-day free trial today and see how your own business can benefit from <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/\">TSplus Remote Access<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

		<p style="text-align: left;"><b>The Root of the Trouble with Internet and Security</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The whole meaning of networking is to share programs and information. But granting others access to a computer device of any kind reveals an open window for those with foul motives, too. In the early days, networks were quite secure because they were closed-in systems. So, to do any harm you had to get physical access to a server wired to the LAN.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Remote access and Internet connections have changed that. Broader availability and falls in the cost of broadband or other Internet connections mean that even home computers can remain linked up to the Internet round-the-clock, which increases the chances for hackers to gain access to them.</p><h2>Internet as a Door Without a Key</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Computer operating systems were originally planned for stand-alone computers only, not networked ones, and security was not an issue. When computer networking came about, applications and operating systems concentrated on easy accessibility rather than security. Because of this earlier focus on accessibility; security was mostly retrofitted into hardware systems.</p><h2>Cyber-Security: Building Locks onto a Key-free System</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Modern operating systems are planned and built with security in mind, but they still have to operate using conventional networking protocols. The fact these still bear the same weaknesses they were found to have can result in security problems.</p><h2>Finding the Balance Between Security and Access</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Security versus access. The users want easy access to resources on the network. Administrators want the network to remain secure. These two goals are at odds. Because access and security are always on conflicting ends of the security scale, the more access you have, the less safe the network can be.</p><p style="text-align: left;">For business computer networks, the key is to hit a balance. On one hand, make sure employees are not annoyed by security measures. And on the other, maintain a level of protection that will keep unauthorized individuals from getting access. At TSplus, we think we've struck that balance with <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a>.</p><h2>Types of Internal Threats to a Network</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Internal network security threats are those that come from within the organization, as opposed to those that come through the Internet. Internal threats can include employees who on purpose attempt to steal data or bring in viruses or attacks on the computer network. often these events will happen by lack of care and due attention, in part because sometimes the threats are not so well known.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Other internal threats are posed by outside employees (contract workers, janitorial services and people posing as utility company employees) who have physical access to the LAN computers.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Though, many internal threats are unintended. Employees may install or use their own software or hardware for a private purpose, unaware that it poses a security threat to their computers and the complete network.</p><h2>Type of External Threats to a Network</h2><p style="text-align: left;">External security threats are those that come from outside the LAN, typically from the Internet. These threats are the ones we usually think of when we talk about hackers and computer network attacks. Such people can make use of flaws and characteristics of computer operating systems and software applications. They take advantage of the way various network communications protocols work. Malicious software will try to use these to do such things as:</p><ul><li>Enter a system and access its data. It will then most likely attempt to read, copy, change or delete some or all of it.</li><li>Break down a system and harm or destroy operating system and application files so they do not work anymore.</li><li>Install one or more viruses and worms that can spread to other systems across the LAN.</li><li>Or use the system to start attacks against other systems or networks.</li></ul><h2>An Army to Guard Those Cyber Gates.</h2><p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Advanced Security comes not as a lone warrior but as a whole team of defenders. Indeed, the software holds an array of tools to ensure the security of your network. It fends off Malware and Brute Force attacks, locks the door to millions of known malicious IPs and can bring a set of customisable security ranging through Home Country, Working Hours and more.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><b>Visit our product pages to check out the features TSplus Advanced Security has to offer. You can download it or any <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus software</a> or you can also try our products first for 15-days for free.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

Because of this earlier focus on accessibility; security was mostly retrofitted into hardware systems.<\/p><h2>Cyber-Security: Building Locks onto a Key-free System<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Modern operating systems are planned and built with security in mind, but they still have to operate using conventional networking protocols. The fact these still bear the same weaknesses they were found to have can result in security problems.<\/p><h2>Finding the Balance Between Security and Access<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Security versus access. The users want easy access to resources on the network. Administrators want the network to remain secure. These two goals are at odds. Because access and security are always on conflicting ends of the security scale, the more access you have, the less safe the network can be.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For business computer networks, the key is to hit a balance. On one hand, make sure employees are not annoyed by security measures. And on the other, maintain a level of protection that will keep unauthorized individuals from getting access. At TSplus, we think we've struck that balance with <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/\">TSplus Advanced Security<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Types of Internal Threats to a Network<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Internal network security threats are those that come from within the organization, as opposed to those that come through the Internet. Internal threats can include employees who on purpose attempt to steal data or bring in viruses or attacks on the computer network. often these events will happen by lack of care and due attention, in part because sometimes the threats are not so well known.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Other internal threats are posed by outside employees (contract workers, janitorial services and people posing as utility company employees) who have physical access to the LAN computers.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Though, many internal threats are unintended. Employees may install or use their own software or hardware for a private purpose, unaware that it poses a security threat to their computers and the complete network.<\/p><h2>Type of External Threats to a Network<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">External security threats are those that come from outside the LAN, typically from the Internet. These threats are the ones we usually think of when we talk about hackers and computer network attacks. Such people can make use of flaws and characteristics of computer operating systems and software applications. They take advantage of the way various network communications protocols work. Malicious software will try to use these to do such things as:<\/p><ul><li>Enter a system and access its data. It will then most likely attempt to read, copy, change or delete some or all of it.<\/li><li>Break down a system and harm or destroy operating system and application files so they do not work anymore.<\/li><li>Install one or more viruses and worms that can spread to other systems across the LAN.<\/li><li>Or use the system to start attacks against other systems or networks.<\/li><\/ul><h2>An Army to Guard Those Cyber Gates.<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">TSplus Advanced Security comes not as a lone warrior but as a whole team of defenders. Indeed, the software holds an array of tools to ensure the security of your network. It fends off Malware and Brute Force attacks, locks the door to millions of known malicious IPs and can bring a set of customisable security ranging through Home Country, Working Hours and more.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Visit our product pages to check out the features TSplus Advanced Security has to offer.

<strong>Supposing that you’ve gone that long way through from choosing the right hosting provider to uploading the final files to your brand-new server. You then proceed with setting up a plethora of other small things like permissions, name-servers, email and ftp accounts.</strong>
<h2>Monitoring Tools for Servers and Websites</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Any idea what some people forget or see as secondary while preparing everything, which becomes one of the most important things once websites or online businesses are launched? Quite simply website uptime and availability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> is a tool to this paramount job. You need to make sure your servers and websites are on full form and also that you know if ever anything goes wrong. Indeed, it is not enough to know that a website is up at one point daily. To be really certain your website is accessible most of the time, you should monitor website and server uptime in a serious and consistent manner.</p>

<h2>Finding Affordable and Reliable Website Monitoring Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">That’s why remote web site monitoring comes into play. The right software is simple and doesn’t need any technical skills to set up. Even thought you may find free monitoring subscriptions with third parties, they could bring up one of the greatest concerns nowadays: that is data privacy. Plus, the other question to come up could be how to monitor your sites if their service goes down.</p>

<h2>Instant 24/7 Server and Website Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With TSplus Server Monitoring, you host the monitoring software and the license you buy is for life. No recurring payments, no data issues. It will start monitoring your websites and servers immediately. You can set the frequency of the surveillance you see live to get more or less detailed visibility of how your network is doing. Once you set up alerts, TSplus Server Monitoring will instantly alert you and your colleagues via email or Teams, about any website downtime and outage.</p>

<h2>Tools for Website Monitoring - Cutting Downtime to the Minimum</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Server Monitoring checks your site in almost the same manner as if you personally came to your web site to see that it is responding and returning proper content. Such monitoring participates in verifying that everything is responding properly and that you can react as rapidly and specifically as possible to any issue. The same goes for knowing your servers are up and fully functional.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With TSplus Server Monitoring, you can keep an eye on all the basics. For server, you see performances such as CPU use, Memory, Disk Write and Read percentages, as well as Process usage, Bandwidth and Users. Meanwhile, you can monitor websites for availability, response codes and response times.</p>

<h2>Monitoring Websites and Servers Remotely for Shorter Downtime</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A main advantage of remote monitoring is that wherever you are or whenever there is an issue, you will be notified so you can look for yourself. You can monitor the uptime of the servers and websites you set-up in your dashboard. What’s more, it does not matter where you are located or where they are hosted, how many locations this means in different parts of the world or different networks.</p>

<h2>Server and Website Monitoring on the Right Scale, from SMBs up</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus software is built to be scalable in use and in price, starting with 1 server, then 5, then 10. That way you pay for what your business requires, and no more, then you can add as it grows.</p>

<h2>Short and Long-Term Website Monitoring and Reporting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can display Servers or Websites, concentrate on a single one of them, manage which are available to be monitored, add new ones or delete any. The statistics are never deleted so you may see daily, weekly, monthly, yearly uptime statistics and average response times for any period.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the long run, instant information has to be compiled to get the bigger picture. TSplus Server Monitoring not only alerts you but bring together all surveillance statistics into reports. You can publish either a standard model or your customised versions. These, you can brand and tailor to your audience. You may not want to provide the same information to your IT team, the marketing or sales teams or the board. This is available in the <a href="https://tsplus.net/">Admin Console</a>.</p>

<h2>4 main questions about Server Monitoring:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Is there free trial period? Yes, we offer a 15-day free trial for any of our software.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">What means of notifications are available? Email, Teams.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">At what frequency or interval do checks occur? Real-time. About 3 logs a minute.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Any additional features? For servers: user presence and application usage, for both servers and websites: customisation of reports (appearance and content).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>As a Conclusion on Server and Website Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remember, an online business can be affected by as little as 10 minutes of daily downtime. Lost revenue and poor reputation are potential direct results. This is a good reason to monitor the availability of your websites and servers. Especially as monitoring them will provide you with peace of mind and help you give a better service to your users and visitors.</p>

		<p><b>Simple - Affordable - Efficient - Secure</b></p>
<p>Remote Access from 32$ per user. For life.</p>
<p>It’s as simple as that.</p><h2>Remote Access - Affordable</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus </a>has been developing simple, secure, efficient and, most interestingly, affordable remote access software for over a decade and is not set to stop. Could it be due to the satisfaction of making available to everyone what was for a long time reserved to the largest and richest?</p>
<h2>Remote Access Alternative Without the Price Tag and Learning Curve</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many software developers or resellers can claim a share of the distant working or application publication markets. Yet, few can rightly claim to being the cheapest while still being as good as some of the biggest. That is central to the TSplus mindset and has paved the road daily for company staff worldwide.</p>
<h2>Remote Access With End-to-end Encryption</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The most important tools to use TSplus software are the Internet, HTML5 and a Web browser. Because of this, TSplus Remote Access communications are end-to-end encrypted and rely amongst other things on SSL certificates for basic security.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nevertheless, the threats of this day and age cannot be easily ignored and TSplus developers have made sure users have the option of 2FA. This will improve any user’s peace of mind. Our teams have also crafted TSplus Advanced Security as an additional product for all-round cyber-protection.</p>
<h2>Simple Application Publishing and Remote Desktop Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, what does TSplus Remote Access offer that makes it proudly take on such a challenge? TSplus Remote Access is primarily application publication software. It is a simple yet versatile tool that can make all or parts of almost any PC available from a distance simply by using native Microsoft RDP. Within a few clicks, you can use a legacy Windows app on your smartphone or tablet or work on your remote desktop as though it were inside your laptop or other device.</p>
<h2>Possibilities and Potential with TSplus Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are all kind of reasons you may want to do that. Here are a few!</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep using that software which you know so well and for which you need no training while still gaining the mobility of doing so from anywhere.</li>
<li>Access memory-heavy apps on a light device which hasn’t the RAM it would otherwise need.</li>
<li>Make applications available to a whole staff team or sets of workplaces without needing to install them on as many machines or in so many places. (And less installation implies less upkeep!)</li>
<li>Create your own SaaS solution, host and manage it.</li>
<li>Make any desktop PC and all its files fit in a back pocket or handbag. It can be accessed when travelling for work or holiday or taken home.</li>
<li>Use Windows-specific software on Mac as though it were a native application.</li>
<li>Lighten the IT workload and budget without cutting down on staff or quality.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>High Potential User-Friendly Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whichever way you take it, it is likely this price won’t be a cause of slow business development. And the best thing is that with barely any technical knowledge, most of these ideas are within reach thanks to the simplicity and user-friendliness of the Admin Console.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Be it publishing applications to the Web or user set-up, for example, the steps are pretty much self-explanatory. Although you can find just about any actions you may need to carry out detailed in the Quick-Start Guide or in the User Guide. And should you ever need exterior help, our highly responsive Support and Sales teams are amongst the best rated in the market.</p>
<h2>Buy or Test to Find Out for Yourself</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Since there is nothing like testing a tool to find out how it feels in our hands, <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">here </a>is the fully-featured 15-day free trial and all you need to know to get started.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

<img width="800" height="450" src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Secure-Remote-Support-Made-Simple-1024x576.png" alt="Article title, TSplus logo and link, illustrated by picture of hands joining as a team." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Secure-Remote-Support-Made-Simple-1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Secure-Remote-Support-Made-Simple-300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Secure-Remote-Support-Made-Simple-768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Secure-Remote-Support-Made-Simple-18x10.png 18w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Secure-Remote-Support-Made-Simple.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />								</a>
<strong>IT teams, MSPs, IT services or repairs providers. Each of these are likely to need to use remote access technology to provide their customers and users with the support they need. <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">Remote Support</a> software has to be reliable and simple since it is regularly required in times of stress and one of the parties is likely to have no prior IT knowledge.</strong>
<h2>Why Secure and Simple Remote Support?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The main aim of remote support is to hand over control of a device to someone else who has the ability to fix the issues the are causing trouble for its user. This means being able to send out the call and validating it and involves a great amount of trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is also worth detailing trust of the agent who is about to take control of the device as well as trust in the software or tool that enables the control. All this to show how important it is to develop a good reliable trustworthy product, especially to contend as a <a href="https://tsplus.net/top-alternatives-to-teamviewer-for-remote-support/">TeamViewer alternative</a> worth exploring.</p>

<h2>Trustworthy Software for Trustworthy Teams</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Support is end-to-end encrypted, uses SSL certificates and requires no installation, thus putting at least one wing of worry to rest. No matter the remote support tool, the second source of worry is perhaps the more complicated to close. It is important to make sure the support agent is indeed who they say they are. And this has to be left to the better judgement of each individual receiving support.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Luckily, in many contexts, users have a contract with a Managed Service Provider, so they will know their names. Or they will have a working relationship with the IT technician or team who are assigned to fixing and updating company devices whether they are the in-house or not. Usually, staff will have access to the names of the staff members or hired persons for the job. All that is left is to check one another's identity before clicking Connect.</p>

<h2>Add-on for Extra Cyber Protection</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, you can also use such remote access or control software with the knowledge that greater protection is provided such as the millions of blocked malicious IP kept at bay by TSplus Advanced Security. The option is a sensible one, though not obligatory.</p>

<h2>IT Issues Need Support Wherever and Whenever</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whatever the device, there are regularly technical issues that need fixing. This is even more useful at a time when distant working is becoming a common or regular occurrence. Remote work may be nothing new to mature support teams and agents, but it certainly is something office and business workers are still getting used to. However, IT issues don’t usually give prior warning so they may occur at any time. Also, most need solving rapidly even when they are not urgent. Hence the advantage of remote support over physical intervention.</p>

<h2>TSplus Remote Support Unattended Access – Anytime Anywhere</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/features/">TSplus Remote Support</a> can for example work directly as each party connect or it can be set for later use. For instance, the agent then has the authorisation to return while the user is away from their workstation. Unattended Access is a feature which grants both the client and the agent a wider time-range for an intervention. This will work out to be an enormous time-saver since many issues will not require the presence of both, save maybe for information or training purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, this feature enables all maintenance and updates to be done silently and out of hours, while servers are less strained or the work won’t slow down other users.</p>

<h2>Simple and Practical Features of TSplus Remote Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other than Unattended Access, many standard features are available starting with screen mouse and keyboard control, clipboard synchronisation, file transfer and chat. There is also the possibility to send command lines. Multi-Monitor means you can swap to display different screens should the client have more than one screen. Remote Support also allows Multi-User session sharing, which is perfect for training and demonstration purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, the customisation features respond to some of the identity related worries mentioned above: agents can customise their profile with their name, job title and a photo, as well as brand the banner and logo of windows visible to customers and clients. Emails are also amongst the items that can be customised.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, the option to host Remote Support on company premises means businesses can rest assured their data will stay safe within company walls.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Simple Affordable and Secure Remote Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><b>Offering a range of useful and carefully considered features, <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> will easily take its place among any company’s IT tools.</b> Be it for in-house, MSP or any other use, TSplus software scale from freelance and SMB size to whatever may be required, both in term of price and licenses. <b>Why wait any longer to discover the best value-for-money contender for TeamViewer’s market?</b></strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

This means being able to send out the call and validating it and involves a great amount of trust.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is also worth detailing trust of the agent who is about to take control of the device as well as trust in the software or tool that enables the control. All this to show how important it is to develop a good reliable trustworthy product, especially to contend as a <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/top-alternatives-to-teamviewer-for-remote-support\/\">TeamViewer alternative<\/a> worth exploring.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Trustworthy Software for Trustworthy Teams<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">TSplus Remote Support is end-to-end encrypted, uses SSL certificates and requires no installation, thus putting at least one wing of worry to rest. No matter the remote support tool, the second source of worry is perhaps the more complicated to close. It is important to make sure the support agent is indeed who they say they are. And this has to be left to the better judgement of each individual receiving support.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Luckily, in many contexts, users have a contract with a Managed Service Provider, so they will know their names. Or they will have a working relationship with the IT technician or team who are assigned to fixing and updating company devices whether they are the in-house or not. Usually, staff will have access to the names of the staff members or hired persons for the job. All that is left is to check one another's identity before clicking Connect.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Add-on for Extra Cyber Protection<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, you can also use such remote access or control software with the knowledge that greater protection is provided such as the millions of blocked malicious IP kept at bay by TSplus Advanced Security. The option is a sensible one, though not obligatory.<\/p>\n\n<h2>IT Issues Need Support Wherever and Whenever<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whatever the device, there are regularly technical issues that need fixing. This is even more useful at a time when distant working is becoming a common or regular occurrence. Remote work may be nothing new to mature support teams and agents, but it certainly is something office and business workers are still getting used to. However, IT issues don\u2019t usually give prior warning so they may occur at any time. Also, most need solving rapidly even when they are not urgent. Hence the advantage of remote support over physical intervention.<\/p>\n\n<h2>TSplus Remote Support Unattended Access \u2013 Anytime Anywhere<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Indeed, <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-support\/features\/\">TSplus Remote Support<\/a> can for example work directly as each party connect or it can be set for later use.

<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Web Servers, FTP and Firewall Zones</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Every network that has an internet connection is at risk of being compromised. Here are some of the steps that will keep networks protected.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whilst there are several steps that you can take to secure your LAN, the only real solution is to close your LAN to incoming traffic and restrict outgoing traffic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Saying that, <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> provides great all-round protection against a whole range of cyber-threats and closes some of the widest open doors.</p>

<h2>Separate Areas for LAN or Exposed DMZ Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, some services such as Web or FTP servers require incoming connections. If you require these services you will need to consider whether it is essential that these servers are part of the LAN, or whether they can be placed in a physically separate network known as a DMZ (or demilitarised zone if you prefer its proper name). Ideally, all servers in the DMZ will be stand-alone servers, with unique logons and passwords for each server. If you require a backup server for machines within the DMZ then you should acquire a dedicated machine and keep the backup solution separate from the LAN backup solution.</p>

<h2>Separate Traffic Routes for LAN and Exposed Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The DMZ will come directly off the firewall, which means that there are two routes in and out of the DMZ, traffic to and from the Internet, and traffic to and from the LAN. Traffic between the DMZ and your LAN would be treated totally separately to traffic between your DMZ and the Internet. Incoming traffic from the internet would be routed directly to your DMZ.</p>

<h2>LAN Hidden by More Exposed DMZ Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Therefore, if any hacker were to compromise a machine within the DMZ, then the only network they would get to access would be the DMZ. The hacker would have little or no access to the LAN. It would also be the case that any virus infection or other security compromise within the LAN would not be able to migrate to the DMZ.</p>

<h2>Minimal Communication for greater security of LAN Devices</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In order for the DMZ to be effective, you will have to keep the traffic between the LAN and the DMZ to a minimum. In the majority of cases, the only traffic required between the LAN and the DMZ is FTP. If you do not have physical access to the servers, you will also need some sort of remote management protocol such as terminal services or VNC.</p>

<h2>TSplus Solutions for Increased LAN and DMZ security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus software</a> is designed to be affordable, simple and secure. Cyber-security has long been a central goal for the company, so much so that our cyber protection product has evolved to become an all-round 360° security tool-kit. TSplus Advanced Security is a simple and affordable defence developed to protect your set-up from malware and ransomware, brute-force attacks, misuse of credentials… And incidentally it blocks millions of known malicious IPs. It also learns from standard user behaviours and you can whitelist addresses that are important as needed.</p>

<h2>Which Place for Database Servers in the Network</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If your web servers require access to a database server, then you will need to consider where to place your database. The most secure place to locate a database server is to create yet another physically separate network called the secure zone, and to place the database server there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Secure zone is also a physically separate network connected directly to the firewall. The Secure zone is by definition the most secure place on the network. The only access to or from the secure zone would be the database connection from the DMZ (and LAN if required).</p>

<h2>Email - An Exception to Network Rules</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The biggest dilemma faced by network engineers may actually be where to put the email server. It requires SMTP connection to the internet, yet it also requires domain access from the LAN. If you were to place this server in the DMZ, the domain traffic would compromise the integrity of the DMZ, making it simply an extension of the LAN. Hence, in our opinion, the only place you can put an email server is on the LAN and allow SMTP traffic into this server.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, we would recommend against allowing any form of HTTP access into this server. If your users require access to their mail from outside the network, it would be far more secure to look at some form of VPN solution. This would require the firewall handling the VPN connections. Indeed, a LAN based VPN server would allow the VPN traffic onto the LAN before it is authenticated, which is never a good thing.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion: LAN, DMZ and Network Setup</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Concerning FTP, whatever choices you make, it is important each is well planned and well thought out. Yet, it is also essential the end-result makes sense and works together as securely as possible. <strong>Be it Advanced Security, Remote Access or any other, TSplus products have security in their DNA. You can buy or test any of them from our product pages.</strong></p>

Cyber-security has long been a central goal for the company, so much so that our cyber protection product has evolved to become an all-round 360\u00b0 security tool-kit. TSplus Advanced Security is a simple and affordable defence developed to protect your set-up from malware and ransomware, brute-force attacks, misuse of credentials\u2026 And incidentally it blocks millions of known malicious IPs. It also learns from standard user behaviours and you can whitelist addresses that are important as needed.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Which Place for Database Servers in the Network<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If your web servers require access to a database server, then you will need to consider where to place your database. The most secure place to locate a database server is to create yet another physically separate network called the secure zone, and to place the database server there.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Secure zone is also a physically separate network connected directly to the firewall. The Secure zone is by definition the most secure place on the network. The only access to or from the secure zone would be the database connection from the DMZ (and LAN if required).<\/p>\n\n<h2>Email - An Exception to Network Rules<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The biggest dilemma faced by network engineers may actually be where to put the email server. It requires SMTP connection to the internet, yet it also requires domain access from the LAN. If you were to place this server in the DMZ, the domain traffic would compromise the integrity of the DMZ, making it simply an extension of the LAN. Hence, in our opinion, the only place you can put an email server is on the LAN and allow SMTP traffic into this server.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, we would recommend against allowing any form of HTTP access into this server. If your users require access to their mail from outside the network, it would be far more secure to look at some form of VPN solution. This would require the firewall handling the VPN connections. Indeed, a LAN based VPN server would allow the VPN traffic onto the LAN before it is authenticated, which is never a good thing.<\/p>\n\n<h2>In Conclusion: LAN, DMZ and Network Setup<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Concerning FTP, whatever choices you make, it is important each is well planned and well thought out. Yet, it is also essential the end-result makes sense and works together as securely as possible. <strong>Be it Advanced Security, Remote Access or any other, TSplus products have security in their DNA.

		Managed hosting may best be described as the premium version of Web hosting. Managed hosting takes a lot of the guesswork and administration out of the hands of the client and into the hands of the managed hosting provider. Managed hosting is much more customized a solution than other pre-packaged basic Web hosting solutions. The price, of course, reflects that. <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus software</a> is a simple and affordable set of tools that can enable MSPs and other providers of IT services to create and manage such services as managed hosting.<h2>Managed Hosting for Top Service</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With managed hosting firms you’ll generally get dedicated servers that are custom built to your firm’s specifications, or configurations with multiple servers. You should get top notch 24 hour and 7 days a week high quality Internet hosting support and a datacentre that has state of the art technology and services.</p>
<h2>Well Monitored Managed Hosting with TSplus</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Managed hosting should offer close to 100 percent uptime guarantee of its network services, and 24-hour security for its data centre. Included in the standard managed hosting services are managed disaster recovery and backup, security and network services, database services, and administration and monitoring of all your firm’s computer systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Different tools will be necessary according to the services you wish to provide. <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> is a simple affordable and very ergonomic server and website monitoring tool. A great basic that won’t break the bank and that provides frequent surveillance of your network and its usage.</p>
<h2>Load Balancing Managed Hosting with TSplus</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If a firm has a large volume of online traffic, it may need the load balancing solution that is offered by most managed hosting vendors. This load balancing will improve the performance of the network by efficiently distributing the site traffic. This keeps each server from being overwhelmed by unexpected activity fluctuations. Having this balance on the server load is crucial to a high degree of availability, to fault tolerance and to clustering. All of these provide reliable Internet and corporate network infrastructures. TSplus Remote Access includes Load Balancing among its features and is a tool for Web enabling applications and accessing devices remotely.</p>
<h2>Security for Managed Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Firewalls are part of managed hosting, and a crucial security requirement. They prevent unauthorized access to the server as well as from it. Managed hosting vendors can place firewalls in both software and hardware or both. All messages that leave or enter the server or the business network would have to pass through this managed hosting firewall, and those that don’t pass security would be blocked.</p>
<h2>Remotely Supporting Managed Hosting with TSplus</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Regular managed hosting backup is a must have to prevent catastrophic business consequences to national or other disaster or outage. Managed hosting vendors offering such backup are able to provide reliable and consistent data protection, as well as recovery.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Managed hosting firms can also help businesses change their network and systems, upgrading, adding options and extending solutions. With remote control tools, most of the tasks involved in all this can be done at a distance, so TSplus Remote Support can prove to be one of the most important assets for MSPs and IT services providers.</p>
<h2>Port Monitoring in Managed Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The best managed hosting vendor will include port monitoring as part of its hosting package. This port monitoring services lets business clients configure the host system so that they monitor the client’s server as well as its ports. This configuration and its maintenance are client responsibilities, and the alerts would be sent directly to the client firm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Should a firm wish to enhance this port monitoring service, the managed hosting package upgrade would provide a greater level of such monitoring. If technicians at the managed hosting firm’s site were to see a system failure, they would restart the failed portion of the equipment. The vendor’s staff would maintain and configure the port monitoring as part of this enhanced package.</p>
<h2>Administrating Hosted Servers and Domains</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The managed hosting administrator for the host server lets the administrator setup the servers and manage and control them. Administrators can create their domains, set up e-mail accounts, create file transfer protocol (FTP) accounts, select interface languages, limit the site traffic, create directories chosen for protection, manage SSL certificates, view the statistics for graphics, and manage multiples of both users and databases.</p>
<h2>Monitoring Statistics from Managed Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Managed hosting Web site statistics are typically very detailed. They need to be configured easily and delivered in formats which can be viewed with any standard Internet browser. Site statistics are generally flexible and quickly available with a good managed hosting vendor. <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">Server Monitoring</a> is the TSplus surveillance tool for servers and websites. With it you will be able to create reports tailored to your brand and customised depending on the items of your network to which you choose to pay attention.</p>
<h2>Multiple Domains and other Possibilities with managed Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Domain licenses are inexpensive managed hosting add-ons, which start at 30 domain licenses, and have no ceiling on the number available. What a Managed Service Provider will offer depends on what they chose as well as what customers may ask for to meet their needs. As with many things related to IT, the limit is for the greatest part set by time, money and inspiration.</p>

<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Application-Service-Providers-and-Hosting-1024x576.png" alt="Article title, TSplus logo and link, illustrated by pictures of computer devices showing TSplus Remote Access screenshot." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Application-Service-Providers-and-Hosting-1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Application-Service-Providers-and-Hosting-300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Application-Service-Providers-and-Hosting-768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Application-Service-Providers-and-Hosting-18x10.png 18w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Application-Service-Providers-and-Hosting.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" width="800" height="450">								</a>
Application service providers have quickly sprouted onto the web hosting scene in an effort to provide businesses with new and innovative services. Here’s what and how as well as some tools for the job. I’ll use the acronym ASP for this article but be mindful, elsewhere, there are quite a few possible confusions for those three letters.
<h2>What are Application Service Providers and Hosting?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">They are companies, basically a third party, who will provide access to applications on what amounts to a rental basis. The service extends to the servers, websites, etc. that make up the network and more according to what offer the ASP decides to put on offer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As remotely-hosted applications can provide cost-effective access for businesses to unique software, many of the applications are designed to be of occasional use in terms of use. Others are geared towards using group connectivity provided through the Internet to offer an application that is flexible.</p>

<h2>Application Service Providers for All Fields and Industries</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The number of applications and services provided through the ASP model is growing. Accordingly, there is a growing number of companies developing software for the ASP marketplace. What sorts of applications are being developed?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ASPs have created software programs to handle various business functions like materials management, human resources, financial management, and e-commerce transaction services.</p>

<h2>Application Service Providers Host Software on Subscription</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A major advantage for businesses seeking ASP services is that they provide an opportunity to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. Companies can often have access to a wider-range of software products with the possibility of paying less than an outright purchase. The cost is spread through usage charges. This allows businesses to access applications that can service particular business needs so companies can focus on their core operations.</p>

<h2>Developing to Provide Better Application Services</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Furthermore, ASPs are developing new software that can provide business solutions to operating issues not previously addressed through PC-based software. They also remove many of the technical administrative and maintenance issues associated with software by providing real-time upgrades, remote hosting, remote dial-in customer support and overall software management.</p>

<h2>Network Management and other Application Services Provided</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Web hosting companies are involved in the development of applications – however, many of the hosting companies serve to provide network management and serve the application remotely to users. In providing ASP-related services, these companies are essentially application infrastructure providers.</p>

<h2>Application</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">For mainframe web hosting applications, ASP service providers are pioneering a new way to host and maintain business applications. These companies save businesses the trouble of having an in-house IT team or needing to take care of the infrastructure or organisation the  network would otherwise entail. Instead, businesses can entrust all this and more to the ASP and get on with what they do best: their line of business.</p>

<h2>Buy or Test to Find Out for Yourself</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>You may be one of the IT technicians who already are in business or one of those who are choosing to set up their ASP company. Either way, you are invited to come discover <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">Remote Access</a> and any other products in our software suite.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">
<img width="800" height="450" src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Help-Desks-and-Support-of-Outsourcing-and-Software--1024x576.png" alt="Article title, TSplus logo and link, illustrated by picture of two people working with headsets and laptops." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Help-Desks-and-Support-of-Outsourcing-and-Software--1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Help-Desks-and-Support-of-Outsourcing-and-Software--300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Help-Desks-and-Support-of-Outsourcing-and-Software--768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Help-Desks-and-Support-of-Outsourcing-and-Software--18x10.png 18w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Help-Desks-and-Support-of-Outsourcing-and-Software-.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />								</a>
A help desk may mean a lot of different things. Basically, it is a source of information and technical support for products, hardware or software. Help-desks are generally staffed by people who can either directly solve the problem or direct the problem to the appropriate department for action.In some instances, a help desk is a call centre that is tasked to handle questions about products and services. Sometimes, it is synonymous of customer services, though oftentimes it is a specific service towards which customer services agents will direct clients. The question of help desks and support outsourcing and software is thus both generic and quite specific to IT alone. Though different companies may use other terms, in IT, we generally find it referred to as support (support service, support team…). It is the case for our product: <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a>.
<h2>Help Desks: Calls, Emails and Contact Forms</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A single point of entry is a common attribute of a help desk. A voice automated telephone system will usually allow users to navigate themselves to reach the correct department. Email or a contact form can be other ways for a customer to initiate contact, triggering a call-back by an available agent. Most help desks are external, but some large companies are able to maintain their own internal help desk functions.</p>

<h2>Outsourcing Help Desks to Absorb Demand Peaks</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">An outsourced agency is best considered for a company when it experiences sharp peaks in calls throughout the day or numbers of available or qualified staff are insufficient to handle current call volumes. Another reason to do so is when certain support activities require expertise or knowledge in an area not frequently used by the company. Experiences of periods of high activity such as during the introduction of a new product or a product maintenance release may also be an appropriate time to make use of an external provider.</p>

<h2>Other Help Desk and Software Outsourcing Advantages</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other reasons to test outsourcing are difficulty in supporting distant offices, large number of software packages or during a company’s internal transition such as upgrading of network or computer system hardware or software. Outsourcing the help desk may ensure support agents have the latest technology. It can be an alternative to large investments in support software you may not otherwise need. Outsourcing the support makes it possible to have teams with the latest knowledge and material at hand without needing to uphold an in-house IT team.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While these technology improvements may be very costly for an individual company, outsourcing facilitates the same advantage by giving the work to entities that are better equipped to handle the work. It can also spread out the cost among several clients over a period of time. In some fields, today’s global economy has made help desk access a requirement 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in order to come out ahead of the competition. Not every business can span all continents and most time-zones with only their in-house staff like we do. An outside agency can provide valuable support especially out of business hours due to being organized specifically to this end.</p>

<h2>Saas for Support Help Desks</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The scope of a help desk service can be as varied as the products being serviced. Other than IT administrators and in-house teams being available, IT businesses such as software developers, providers or resellers and other SaaS or similar services can need to provide troubleshooting and maintenance. For example, our own support service comprises a technical team capable of remotely assisting customers and controlling their devices at a distance to solve any issues. They also have the know-ho to provide their clients with the appropriate information and knowledge to deal with situations themselves. Some providers may draw up service level agreements specifying the range of services to be provided as well as those not provided by the technical help desk support staff. Remote Access and Control forms a core part of the service IT help desks provide. Their work brings together multiple resources to address an issue.</p>

<h2>Software for IT Support and Help Desks</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The many features of a telephone help desk environment are automated through the use of specific call-management software. <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> software covers the second area IT is concerned with, namely remote control.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of the more typical telephone software tool functions include call management, call tracking, knowledge management, problem resolution and self-help capabilities. This software is provided for the use of all members of the support area from the first point of contact up to the staff that eventually receives the job request for resolution. These can be useful to sales and other teams as well as some technical teams.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote control software, on the other hand, is used specifically by technical teams and IT administrators. It serves to remotely control a device’s screen, keyboard and mouse and perform other specific actions meant to enable agents to fix issues from a distance.</p>

<h2>Remote Support Software by TSplus</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Support is a screen, mouse and keyboard control software designed to be as simple and user-friendly as possible while nonetheless providing the essentials for a good job and keeping work secure. Basics such as chat box, file transfer, clipboard, send command are all there, along with multi-screen, invite multi-users, unattended access and <a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/remote-support-v3/admin-console">device-list management</a>. And because it is important for companies to provide a branded and company-coherent service, the appearance of our support software can be customised with colours, logos and brief messages.</p>

<h2>To Conclude on Outsourcing Help Desks and Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Outsourcing is fast becoming the choice option of many companies that seek to lower costs and improve service quality while taking their business capabilities to an entirely new level. The main point is to be able to outsource skilled or non-essential tasks to make it possible for the company to focus on core tasks within its capabilities, thus gaining the competitive advantage against its opponents. In some cases, outsourcing is crucial to business success and competitiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Software is an essential tool and can make all the difference to any team within a company. Nowadays, rare are the teams needing no software whatsoever within their sphere of work or at least surrounding their jobs since even agendas and notebooks have become digital. Whether it is purchased or leased, much thought and preparation is in order if businesses want to keep the edge in certain areas.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>The certain advantage of SaaS is the peace of mind it brings in return for the subscription. Indeed, leasing the software means Remote Support is updated to the latest version when you launch it. Since patching and updates are paramount for security reasons, it would be a winner even before knowing its maintenance is therefore covered. For MSPs, such a product is great for freeing non-IT companies to concentrate on the field of work. <a href="https://tsplus.net/pricing/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> is a SaaS with all updates and hosting taken care of.

		<p>A network is a group of computers, printers, and other devices that are connected together with cables or a wireless system for sharing of data and resources. Information travels through cables or over radio waves. This allows network users to exchange documents and data with each other, print to the same printers, and generally share any hardware or software that is connected to the network.</p><h2>Networks, or Building the Net Between the Dots</h2><p>Each dot, that is: each computer, printer or other peripheral device which is connected to the network, is called a node. Networks can have tens, thousands, or even millions of nodes. <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> software is a perfect tool to make either data, applications or both accessible and usable by various interlinked nodes.</p><h2>Networking via Physical or Wireless Access</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Cabling, network adapters, network cabling, network interface cards or NICs, hubs… These are all pieces of the networking puzzle in a hard-wired context. But Wi-Fi, mobile networks and the Internet in all their forms have taken networking one step further. They have created a shift away from wires and cables towards ever greater mobility. Distances are not restricted to 1, 2, 5 or 10 meters or whichever length of cable. Instead, they are dictated by how good a signal and receiver can be.</p><h2>Networking Basics: LANs (Local Area Networks)</h2><p style="text-align: left;">A network is any collection of independent computers that communicate with one another over a shared network medium. LANs are networks usually confined to a geographic area, such as a single building or a college campus. They can be small, linking as few as three computers. Yet, they often link hundreds of computers used by thousands of people. The development of standard networking protocols and media has resulted in worldwide proliferation of LANs throughout business and educational organisations.</p><h2>Networking Basics: WANs (Wide Area Networks)</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Often a network is located in multiple physical places. Wide area networking combines multiple LANs that are geographically separate. This is accomplished by connecting the different LANs using services such as dedicated leased phone lines, dial-up phone lines (both synchronous and asynchronous), satellite links, and data packet carrier services.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Wide area networking can be as simple as a modem or router with a remote access server for employees to dial into. Or it can be as complex as hundreds of branch offices globally linked. In this case a WAN would use special routing protocols and filters to minimize the expense of sending data sent over vast distances.</p><h2>Networking Basics: Internet and the World Wide Web</h2><p style="text-align: left;">The Internet is a system of linked networks that are worldwide in scope and facilitate data communication services on a global scale. These services include the likes of remote login, file transfer, electronic mail, the World Wide Web and newsgroups.</p><p style="text-align: left;">With the meteoric rise in demand for connectivity, the Internet has become a communications highway for millions of users. It was initially restricted to military and academic institutions, but now is a full-fledged conduit for any and all forms of information and commerce. Internet websites now provide personal, educational, political and economic resources to every corner of the planet.</p><h2>Developing to Provide Better Application Services</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Furthermore, ASPs are developing new software that can provide business solutions to operating issues not previously addressed through PC-based software. They also remove many of the technical administrative and maintenance issues associated with software by providing real-time upgrades, remote hosting, remote dial-in customer support and overall software management.</p><h2>Networking Basics: Intranets</h2><p style="text-align: left;">With the advancements made in browser-based software for the Internet, many private companies are implementing intranets. An intranet is a private network utilising Internet-type tools, but available only within that organisation. For large organisations, an intranet provides employees with an easy access mode to corporate information.</p><h2>Networking Basics: Ethernet</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Ethernet is a popular type of physical layer (cable) LAN technology because it strikes a good balance between speed, cost and ease of installation. Combined with a wide acceptance in the computer marketplace and the ability to support virtually all popular network protocols, these benefits make Ethernet an ideal networking technology for most computer users today.</p><h2>Standards &amp; Preferences for Local and Remote Networks</h2><p style="text-align: left;">There are international standards defining rules for configuring pretty much any type of network as well as specifying how elements in a network interact with one another. By adhering to these IEEE standards, network equipment and network protocols can communicate efficiently.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Although LAN, WAN or ethernet may be favoured for networking within a company, Wi-Fi and other wireless networks are increasingly chosen for the lack of complexity and physical set-up they require.</p><h2>Networking Basics: Network Protocols</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Network protocols are standards that allow computers to communicate. A protocol defines how computers identify one another on a network, the form that the data should take in transit, and how this information is processed once it reaches its final destination. Protocols also define procedures for handling lost or damaged transmissions or "packets". TCP/IP is the main type of network protocol in use today, though many more existed before standardisation.</p><p style="text-align: left;">One level of protocols will actually encrypt the data being transported. It also includes a certificate system called SSL or TLS. A great deal of the security of any network depends on this set of protocols, so much so that these have now become essential in all open networks. That is why <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#security">TSplus </a>implements TLS in its software.</p><h2>Networking Basics: Network Topologies</h2><p style="text-align: left;">A network topology is the geometric arrangement of nodes and cable links in a LAN. Topologies (shapes) are used in two general configurations: bus and star. These two topologies define how nodes are connected to one another. A node is an active device connected to the network, such as a computer or a printer. A node can also be a piece of networking equipment such as a hub, a switch or a router.</p><p style="text-align: left;">A bus topology consists of nodes linked together in a series with each node connected to a long cable or bus. Many nodes can tap into the bus and begin communication with all other nodes on that cable segment. A break anywhere in the cable will usually cause the entire segment to be inoperable until the break is repaired.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Some Ethernet setups use a star topology, in which access is controlled by a central computer. Generally, a computer is located at one end of the segment, and the other end is terminated in a central location with a hub. The primary advantage of this type of network is reliability, for if one of these 'point-to-point' segments has a break, it will only affect the two nodes on that link. Other computer users on the network continue to operate as if that segment were non-existent.</p><h2>Remote &amp; as a Team: Peer-to-Peer Networks</h2><p style="text-align: left;">A peer-to-peer network allows two or more PCs to pool their resources together. Individual resources like disk drives, CD-ROM drives, and even printers are transformed into shared, collective resources that are accessible from every PC. Network software package must be installed onto all of the PCs. In a peer-to-peer network, the information stored across peer-to-peer networks is uniquely decentralized. This is quite unlike client-server networks, where network information is stored on a centralized file server PC and made available to tens, hundreds, or thousands of client PCs.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Because peer-to-peer PCs have their own hard disk drives that are accessible by all computers, each PC acts as both a client (information requestor) and a server (information provider). By far the easiest type of network to build, peer-to-peer is perfect for both home and office use.</p><h2>Remote &amp; All Answering to One: Client-Server Networks</h2><p style="text-align: left;">In a client-server environment, files are stored on a centralized, high speed file server PC that is made available to client PCs. Network access speeds are usually faster than those found on peer-to-peer networks, explaining the vast numbers of clients that this architecture can support. Nearly all network services like printing and electronic mail are routed through the file server, which allows networking tasks to be tracked. Inefficient network segments can be reworked to make them faster, and users' activities can be closely monitored.</p><h2>Remote Access in Networking: Save on Infrastructure &amp; Individual Installations</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Because drives can be easily shared between peer-to-peer PCs, applications only need to be installed on one computer rather than all. Let us consider for example a pair of users who have one copy of Microsoft Word. The software can be installed on user A's computer and yet still used by user B.</p><p style="text-align: left;">In a client-server set-up, public data and applications are stored on the file server, where they are run from client PCs' locations. This also simplifies the task of upgrading software since network administrators can simply upgrade the applications stored on the file server, rather than having to physically upgrade each client PC. Because the clients' primary applications and files are stored in a common location, client PCs will be separate and subordinate to the file server. File servers are often set up so that each user on the network has access to his or her "own" directory, along with a range of "public" directories where applications are stored.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Those are the main reasons <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> is such a time and infrastructure saving tool. But there is more.</p><h2>Remote Access in Networking: Save Computer Parks and Legacy Applications</h2><p style="text-align: left;">The fact it is not only about remote access but also about application publication is very important. Let us look at this capacity to publish applications to the Web. Here are 2 great benefits.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Countless numbers of workstations that would become obsolete because they haven’t the power to run the applications themselves can now seamlessly use them via Remote Access. Just the same, any legacy application can be published to the Web using Remote Access and used on devices running a different OS, from much newer generation and more.</p><h2>Remote Access for Networking: the Sky’s the Limit</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Remote Access software has shifted the importance of computer networking into the ether, inviting mobile phones and more into the game. Indeed, millions of the computers are networked together to form the Internet but millions more tablets and smartphones are too.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Like networking, remote access now plays a crucial role in every kind of organization, small, medium or large, public or private, education, commerce or research oriented, and even in homes. In short, they play their role everywhere where computers and other networking devices are used, globally.</p><h2>TSplus Remote Access for Simple Efficient Networking of Applications</h2><p style="text-align: left;"><b>Any device, any application, anywhere… Boundaries are growing increasingly distant in networking as in many other fields.

This allows network users to exchange documents and data with each other, print to the same printers, and generally share any hardware or software that is connected to the network.<\/p><h2>Networks, or Building the Net Between the Dots<\/h2><p>Each dot, that is: each computer, printer or other peripheral device which is connected to the network, is called a node. Networks can have tens, thousands, or even millions of nodes. <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/\">TSplus Remote Access<\/a> software is a perfect tool to make either data, applications or both accessible and usable by various interlinked nodes.<\/p>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>Networking via Physical or Wireless Access<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Cabling, network adapters, network cabling, network interface cards or NICs, hubs\u2026 These are all pieces of the networking puzzle in a hard-wired context. But Wi-Fi, mobile networks and the Internet in all their forms have taken networking one step further. They have created a shift away from wires and cables towards ever greater mobility. Distances are not restricted to 1, 2, 5 or 10 meters or whichever length of cable. Instead, they are dictated by how good a signal and receiver can be.<\/p><h2>Networking Basics: LANs (Local Area Networks)<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A network is any collection of independent computers that communicate with one another over a shared network medium. LANs are networks usually confined to a geographic area, such as a single building or a college campus. They can be small, linking as few as three computers. Yet, they often link hundreds of computers used by thousands of people. The development of standard networking protocols and media has resulted in worldwide proliferation of LANs throughout business and educational organisations.<\/p><h2>Networking Basics: WANs (Wide Area Networks)<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Often a network is located in multiple physical places. Wide area networking combines multiple LANs that are geographically separate. This is accomplished by connecting the different LANs using services such as dedicated leased phone lines, dial-up phone lines (both synchronous and asynchronous), satellite links, and data packet carrier services.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Wide area networking can be as simple as a modem or router with a remote access server for employees to dial into. Or it can be as complex as hundreds of branch offices globally linked. In this case a WAN would use special routing protocols and filters to minimize the expense of sending data sent over vast distances.<\/p><h2>Networking Basics: Internet and the World Wide Web<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Internet is a system of linked networks that are worldwide in scope and facilitate data communication services on a global scale. These services include the likes of remote login, file transfer, electronic mail, the World Wide Web and newsgroups.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With the meteoric rise in demand for connectivity, the Internet has become a communications highway for millions of users. It was initially restricted to military and academic institutions, but now is a full-fledged conduit for any and all forms of information and commerce. Internet websites now provide personal, educational, political and economic resources to every corner of the planet.<\/p><h2>Developing to Provide Better Application Services<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Furthermore, ASPs are developing new software that can provide business solutions to operating issues not previously addressed through PC-based software. They also remove many of the technical administrative and maintenance issues associated with software by providing real-time upgrades, remote hosting, remote dial-in customer support and overall software management.<\/p><h2>Networking Basics: Intranets<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With the advancements made in browser-based software for the Internet, many private companies are implementing intranets. An intranet is a private network utilising Internet-type tools, but available only within that organisation. For large organisations, an intranet provides employees with an easy access mode to corporate information.<\/p><h2>Networking Basics: Ethernet<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ethernet is a popular type of physical layer (cable) LAN technology because it strikes a good balance between speed, cost and ease of installation. Combined with a wide acceptance in the computer marketplace and the ability to support virtually all popular network protocols, these benefits make Ethernet an ideal networking technology for most computer users today.<\/p><h2>Standards &amp; Preferences for Local and Remote Networks<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are international standards defining rules for configuring pretty much any type of network as well as specifying how elements in a network interact with one another. By adhering to these IEEE standards, network equipment and network protocols can communicate efficiently.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Although LAN, WAN or ethernet may be favoured for networking within a company, Wi-Fi and other wireless networks are increasingly chosen for the lack of complexity and physical set-up they require.<\/p><h2>Networking Basics: Network Protocols<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Network protocols are standards that allow computers to communicate. A protocol defines how computers identify one another on a network, the form that the data should take in transit, and how this information is processed once it reaches its final destination. Protocols also define procedures for handling lost or damaged transmissions or \"packets\". TCP\/IP is the main type of network protocol in use today, though many more existed before standardisation.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">One level of protocols will actually encrypt the data being transported. It also includes a certificate system called SSL or TLS. A great deal of the security of any network depends on this set of protocols, so much so that these have now become essential in all open networks. That is why <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/features\/#security\">TSplus <\/a>implements TLS in its software.<\/p><h2>Networking Basics: Network Topologies<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A network topology is the geometric arrangement of nodes and cable links in a LAN. Topologies (shapes) are used in two general configurations: bus and star. These two topologies define how nodes are connected to one another. A node is an active device connected to the network, such as a computer or a printer. A node can also be a piece of networking equipment such as a hub, a switch or a router.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A bus topology consists of nodes linked together in a series with each node connected to a long cable or bus. Many nodes can tap into the bus and begin communication with all other nodes on that cable segment. A break anywhere in the cable will usually cause the entire segment to be inoperable until the break is repaired.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some Ethernet setups use a star topology, in which access is controlled by a central computer. Generally, a computer is located at one end of the segment, and the other end is terminated in a central location with a hub.

<p style="text-align: left;">A password should be of minimum of 8 characters and contain upper case and lower case characters, be alpha-numeric and include at least one special character such as punctuation signs, percentage, currency signs, etc. It is better to avoid words or dates, especially if they are easily guessed (user, admin, …).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Uncrackable passwords are the key: uppercase in the middle not just at the beginning as well as inter-spaced numbers. <a href="https://tsplus.net/two-factor-authentication/">2FA </a>is a brilliant additional tool in this fight to protect credentials.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Major accounts that need protection are the administrator account but also any others created during the installation of Windows.</p>
<h2>2: Make wise and scant use of administrator accounts.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Change user passwords by logging in using administrator privileges but avoid using the administrator account for general use and browsing. This will keep an extra layer of security between all administrator rights and the main source of danger and trouble: exchanges with the Internet. If ever an attack takes place stealing passwords and other credentials, this will buy extra time to notice and crack down on the threat before it can get to the core of your device.</p>
<h2>3: Prevent break ins or use of security scanners by installing a firewall.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is a software or hardware device that is configured to detect and prevent unauthorized or remote access to the computer. A firewall notes the address from which an access request is received and then permits or denies access. Generally, all home Internet sharing systems have an inbuilt firewall such as Windows Defender. Nonetheless, software firewalls are available online, though it is worth bearing in mind to make sure the source is trustworthy before choosing.</p>
<h2>4: Install antivirus software.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Antivirus software will scan the system automatically once a week and check any e-mails that seem suspicious. Be sure to periodically update the program: computer viruses proliferate each day. Many antivirus programs update themselves automatically.</p>
<h2>5: Be vigilant about spyware and adware.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">These programs collect data and advertise products. They are installed without permission and collect data from computer for use in marketing. To curtail such practices, use a reputable spyware finding tool. Many spyware finding tools are available free.</p>
<h2>6: Block all security lapses or holes in Windows.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As any device or network will only be as strong as its weakest entry-point, this is paramount. These weaknesses are exploited by malicious users to infect computer systems shutting them down and spreading to other associated systems. Use tools like security patches provided by the manufacturer of your operating system to remove dangers.</p>
<h2>7: Change the user-name of the administrative account.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It has full control of the files and system settings. It is usually named Admin or administrator by default, which is as easily guessed as 0000 or 1234 for a mobile. As this account is a main target to hackers, renaming the account strengthens security measures and will help protect your system.</p>
<h2>8: Disable ‘hidden shares” if present in your operating system.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This used to be present in Windows 2000 as well as XP. This permitted others with the username and password to remotely access all your files and data. Recent operating systems have RDP and RDS. These are in a way descendants of the original sharing protocols, but they now should be functions that require activating and enabling.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For safer use of these facilities,<a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/"> Advanced Security</a> can keep watch.</p>
<h2>9: Change Security settings.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Often, code can be used to infect your computer. Avoid trouble by raising the default security level to high. Function effectively by placing oft used web sites in the ‘trusted sites’ Internet zone. Doing this will allow unrestricted viewing of most used sites.</p>
<h2>10: Configure your browser security settings.</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Generally, recent browsers have a lot more security features than older versions used to provide. Set basic security on high and allow only essential cookies, ban sites you don’t trust. Choose a browser you trust as well as like to use. There are many reliable options.</p>
<h2>11: Secure shared files by securing and configuring the guest user account and Remember to Hit Save</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Password-protect or disable the guest-user option.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, be safe: always back up your data, regularly, and keep well informed of developments in the field of security.</p>
<h2>Software amongst Security Measures for Keeping Your PC Safe</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There you have it, a long list after all, and only a start. <b>Though, to help you on your way and even do some of this for you, we have some solid cyber armour.</b></p>

Whatever your reason for having one or more servers or websites, you are likely to need to keep an eye on their performance to make sure they are accessible and in full functioning order.
<h2>Server and Websites, a Global Commodity?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Managed Services Providers, IT Teams, IT Support rely on servers and websites for their business as well as day to day operations and to hold and manage their data. This is also increasingly true of public services, governmental or non-governmental organisations, charitable, academic, research or religious organisations, individuals plus countless other businesses, with no direct relation to IT.</p>

<h2>Staying Operational With Internet, Servers and Websites</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Internet is by far one of the most widespread tools for any business, organisation or group today, however small or large. It is therefore not uncommon for a great proportion of businesses, organisations and groups of all sizes to need to make sure their servers and websites are up and running smoothly, whether they own or lease them.</p>

<h2>The Need for Simple Server Monitoring to Keep Updated on Servers and Websites</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tsplus.net/about-us/">TSplus</a>, as a company and team, is conscious of this heightened importance of the Internet and of so many aspects of IT. The target of developing simple efficient software is thus part of the company’s everyday aim. Simplicity has all its place in this current context.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, many people monitoring their websites or servers will be trained well-practiced IT technicians and agents used to the tools of their trade. Yet numerous others will not be up to date, have not got the technical knowledge but still need to keep on top of things somehow. And, whichever the situation, how often do staff teams have endless amounts of time to spend on learning how to use a new piece of software.</p>

<h2>Simplicity is the Key: TSplus Server Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, we noticed how tight on time and resources most companies and organisations could be (as well as how some providers expect their clients to overflow with both). We also realised how much we like to work with smooth, responsive, ergonomic and straightforward tools, of both the tangible and the virtual sort. Finally, we are quite clear about what is essential to someone on surveillance duty over server and websites since it is part of our jobs</p>

<h2>Monitor Your Servers in All Simplicity</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consequently, with Server Monitoring, you will find yourself accomplishing the following in moments for your servers: monitoring performance, process usage, bandwidth and user connections, in real-time; easy generation and customisation, exporting, printing or emailing of reports; monitoring of user-presence and attendance per server and period of time; monitoring application usage per server and user and optimising your set-up and needs.</p>

<h2>And Monitor Your Websites in All Simplicity</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Specifically for Websites, you can monitor uptime of websites over the previous 30 days, watch availability, response codes and response times, generate, export, print and email reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like Reports, Alerts Management is available for both Servers and Websites so you can be warned via your chosen notification means if, for example, any of the thresholds you set are reached.</p>

<h2>Test Server Monitoring Today</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">All these features are accessible in a well-designed admin tool which is easy to navigate and quite self-explanatory.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>But enough of this since you can find out <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">first-hand</a> what is possible with our simple user-friendly monitoring toolkit.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

This is also increasingly true of public services, governmental or non-governmental organisations, charitable, academic, research or religious organisations, individuals plus countless other businesses, with no direct relation to IT.<\/p><h2>Staying Operational With Internet, Servers and Websites<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Internet is by far one of the most widespread tools for any business, organisation or group today, however small or large. It is therefore not uncommon for a great proportion of businesses, organisations and groups of all sizes to need to make sure their servers and websites are up and running smoothly, whether they own or lease them.<\/p><h2>The Need for Simple Server Monitoring to Keep Updated on Servers and Websites<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/about-us\/\">TSplus<\/a>, as a company and team, is conscious of this heightened importance of the Internet and of so many aspects of IT. The target of developing simple efficient software is thus part of the company\u2019s everyday aim. Simplicity has all its place in this current context.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Indeed, many people monitoring their websites or servers will be trained well-practiced IT technicians and agents used to the tools of their trade. Yet numerous others will not be up to date, have not got the technical knowledge but still need to keep on top of things somehow. And, whichever the situation, how often do staff teams have endless amounts of time to spend on learning how to use a new piece of software.<\/p><h2>Simplicity is the Key: TSplus Server Monitoring<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, we noticed how tight on time and resources most companies and organisations could be (as well as how some providers expect their clients to overflow with both). We also realised how much we like to work with smooth, responsive, ergonomic and straightforward tools, of both the tangible and the virtual sort. Finally, we are quite clear about what is essential to someone on surveillance duty over server and websites since it is part of our jobs<\/p><h2>Monitor Your Servers in All Simplicity<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Consequently, with Server Monitoring, you will find yourself accomplishing the following in moments for your servers: monitoring performance, process usage, bandwidth and user connections, in real-time; easy generation and customisation, exporting, printing or emailing of reports; monitoring of user-presence and attendance per server and period of time; monitoring application usage per server and user and optimising your set-up and needs.<\/p><h2>And Monitor Your Websites in All Simplicity<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Specifically for Websites, you can monitor uptime of websites over the previous 30 days, watch availability, response codes and response times, generate, export, print and email reports.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Like Reports, Alerts Management is available for both Servers and Websites so you can be warned via your chosen notification means if, for example, any of the thresholds you set are reached.<\/p><h2>Test Server Monitoring Today<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">All these features are accessible in a well-designed admin tool which is easy to navigate and quite self-explanatory.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>But enough of this since you can find out <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/server-monitoring\/\">first-hand<\/a> what is possible with our simple user-friendly monitoring toolkit.<\/b><\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

<h2>Growing Need to Remotely Access and Support Devices?</h2>
Many IT departments are operating in down-sized as well as under-staffed environments. Employees are therefore being forced to manage an exceptional amount of mission-critical server room equipment, much more than what they can handle. As a consequence, their ability to remotely monitor and repair computer problems on the go is essential, whether in a corporate context or a provider’s modern data centre.
<h2>Solutions for Remote Access and Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The following two remote monitoring options available for controlling computers over IP will allow network administrators to view computers and access problems as they arise. Read on for some similitudes and differences between two of the most popular methods of remote access computer management in the industry today.</p>

<h2>Hardware or Software Solutions for Remote Access and Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Both hardware and software based remote computer management solutions offer users valuable remote IP access when needed. However, each solution holds their own when comparisons are drawn between these unique solutions. Hardware-based hypervisor devices and software-based remote desktop clients perform so that it seems you are sitting directly in front of the target system. This makes it manageable from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. That main feature set aside, let us see how they work and what they do.</p>

<h2>Virtualisation and RDP Solutions for Remote Access Management and Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A closer look behind the hardware component of Windows equivalents to KVM over IP and the software driven Remote Desktop makes them appear as two very similar remote access methods. In order to truly understand the key features as well as their limitations here is a quick break-down of each individual solution. This will lead us into introducing our <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> remote control software solution.</p>

<h2>Hypervisor Remote Access Management and Support Solution</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hypervisors are a hardware-based solution which allows users to gain both in-band and out-of-band access to all the servers either connected to hypervisor switch or directly connected to a single computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Late night trips to the data centre to reboot one server have become a thing of the past because of this simple yet robust hardware component. The virtual front-end will connect directly to a computer or hypervisor switch and permits remote users to gain secure BIOS-level access to manage mission-critical servers. Remote IP management is generally conducted through a standard internet browser session. Front-end IP products work their magic by allowing remote users to gain full keyboard, video monitor, mouse access of any attached computers from any location with internet connectivity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some client software is automatically downloaded from the hardware device, eliminating the need to install “client” software on each user desktop. Furthermore, particular client software supports most major Web browsers. Different numbers of users can remotely access the same server for a team troubleshooting approach.</p>

<h2>Remote Desktop Software as a Remote Access Management and Support Solution</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote access software programs take advantage of easily loading software on the local computer or, in some cases, both local and remote computers. They also allow users to view and take remote control of keyboard, mouse and video monitors to view and access servers in the data centre from any location with internet capabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are several types of remote management software and many developers and resellers. Some can only be used on Windows-based computer systems, while, on the other hand, others can be used across operating system and environments.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although most remote access software is simple to load and though individual use may even be free, the fact that certain products require the remote management software to be installed on every machine needing remote connectivity in the data centre. Also, one thing to bear in mind regarding remote access software is the fact that it will also often require having the remote operating systems up and running at the application level for the remote session to work properly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If the operating system crashes on the remote computer at any time during remote connectivity users will be forced to find alternative ways to activate the remote computer. This will result in needing to physically reboot the remote server from a cold start in most cases.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Using a platform independent software approach requires users to load software on both client and server computers. In addition, the local and remote computers do not need to be running the same operating system.</p>

<h2>Conclusions on Virtualisation or RDP for Remote Access and Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Clearly there are advantages and disadvantages on either side. Each has particular potential and specific requirements. That said, one aspect that is interesting nowadays is the lightness of remote access compared to virtualisation. Indeed, the hypervisor tools are likely to be more greedy of bandwidth and live memory for the local device and its connection, whereas particular remote software such as <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus </a>need little of either, since the processing happens within the server while the remote device has the charge of displaying everything on the user’s screen.</p>

<h2>TSplus Solutions for Remote Access and Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>TSplus Remote Support, Remote Access and Remote Work are all useful in various aspects of what remote access management can comprise. Here, Remote Support is the key product since its main purpose is the control of remote devices.</strong></p>

Hardware-based hypervisor devices and software-based remote desktop clients perform so that it seems you are sitting directly in front of the target system. This makes it manageable from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. That main feature set aside, let us see how they work and what they do.<\/p><h2>Virtualisation and RDP Solutions for Remote Access Management and Support<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A closer look behind the hardware component of Windows equivalents to KVM over IP and the software driven Remote Desktop makes them appear as two very similar remote access methods. In order to truly understand the key features as well as their limitations here is a quick break-down of each individual solution. This will lead us into introducing our <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-support\/\">TSplus Remote Support<\/a> remote control software solution.<\/p><h2>Hypervisor Remote Access Management and Support Solution<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Hypervisors are a hardware-based solution which allows users to gain both in-band and out-of-band access to all the servers either connected to hypervisor switch or directly connected to a single computer.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Late night trips to the data centre to reboot one server have become a thing of the past because of this simple yet robust hardware component. The virtual front-end will connect directly to a computer or hypervisor switch and permits remote users to gain secure BIOS-level access to manage mission-critical servers. Remote IP management is generally conducted through a standard internet browser session. Front-end IP products work their magic by allowing remote users to gain full keyboard, video monitor, mouse access of any attached computers from any location with internet connectivity.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some client software is automatically downloaded from the hardware device, eliminating the need to install \u201cclient\u201d software on each user desktop. Furthermore, particular client software supports most major Web browsers. Different numbers of users can remotely access the same server for a team troubleshooting approach.<\/p><h2>Remote Desktop Software as a Remote Access Management and Support Solution<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Remote access software programs take advantage of easily loading software on the local computer or, in some cases, both local and remote computers. They also allow users to view and take remote control of keyboard, mouse and video monitors to view and access servers in the data centre from any location with internet capabilities.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are several types of remote management software and many developers and resellers. Some can only be used on Windows-based computer systems, while, on the other hand, others can be used across operating system and environments.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Although most remote access software is simple to load and though individual use may even be free, the fact that certain products require the remote management software to be installed on every machine needing remote connectivity in the data centre. Also, one thing to bear in mind regarding remote access software is the fact that it will also often require having the remote operating systems up and running at the application level for the remote session to work properly.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If the operating system crashes on the remote computer at any time during remote connectivity users will be forced to find alternative ways to activate the remote computer. This will result in needing to physically reboot the remote server from a cold start in most cases.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Using a platform independent software approach requires users to load software on both client and server computers. In addition, the local and remote computers do not need to be running the same operating system.<\/p><h2>Conclusions on Virtualisation or RDP for Remote Access and Support<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Clearly there are advantages and disadvantages on either side. Each has particular potential and specific requirements. That said, one aspect that is interesting nowadays is the lightness of remote access compared to virtualisation. Indeed, the hypervisor tools are likely to be more greedy of bandwidth and live memory for the local device and its connection, whereas particular remote software such as <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">TSplus <\/a>need little of either, since the processing happens within the server while the remote device has the charge of displaying everything on the user\u2019s screen.<\/p><h2>TSplus Solutions for Remote Access and Support<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>TSplus Remote Support, Remote Access and Remote Work are all useful in various aspects of what remote access management can comprise. Here, Remote Support is the key product since its main purpose is the control of remote devices.<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Use our software to remotely support colleagues or clients, remotely fix issues and update software seamlessly, silently and efficiently, collaborate for training or problem solving.

Businesses around the world are being bombarded with sophisticated threats against their data and communications networks every day.

Already, enterprises invest heavily in fortifying their IT infrastructures and enforcing comprehensive and constantly upgraded security policies against malicious code attacks. As though there was not enough to watch out for, another home-grown threat - the mobile workforce - has opened the floodgates, threatening to compromise enterprise data and contaminate corporate networks.
<h2>Enabling Work Outside the Firewall Perimeter</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In spite of mobile working offering some advantages in commercial and operational value, it is clear enterprise security policies risk stifling the effectiveness and productivity of mobile workforce devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here we examine why best of breed software, in isolation, is not able to provide the mobile workforce and their laptops with the same high-level security afforded to office-based workers and why we think our <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">Advanced Security</a> solution brings together the best of both worlds.</p>

<h2>Two Lines of Defence in a Protected Corporate Environment:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Currently organisations anticipate, detect, and prevent threats from laptop and other mobile device attacks via a layered approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is coupled with centralized, uncompromising IT policy which overrides an individual’s control over their own laptop.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As IT departments prioritise corporate IT governance, their primary method of effectively enforcing organizational security policies is by controlling all networking components.</p>

<h2>First Line of Defence: Corporate Hardware and Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">When connecting to the Internet from within the corporate network, laptop users are protected by two lines of defence.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A comprehensive set of IT security appliances running secured and hardened Operating Systems, and security software including firewalls, intrusion prevention/detection system, antivirus, anti-spyware, anti-spam, and content filtering, all of which are completely controlled by the respective corporate IT team.</p>

<h2>Second Line of Defence: Individual Device Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is coupled with personal firewall and antivirus software installed on the user’s laptop and controlled by the user.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, when laptops are within the protective corporate environment, the organization’s IT department can exercise full and consistent control over (and visibility of) any device, which is a critical operational consideration. This means the IT team can:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>consistently update respective laptops with data, policies, etc., and</li>
 	<li>monitor the entire network effectively vis-à-vis the status of all network components.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Outside the safe zone: Need for Protection Beyond the Firewall</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once a laptop starts 'roaming' outside the enterprise governed network, the 2-line defence system no longer applies. Indeed, in practice, the laptop, is no longer protected by the corporate security appliances layer. This leaves it exclusively dependent on the security software installed on the local operating system.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The roaming laptop is exposed to potential threats from nearby wireless and wireline devices (in hotels, business lounges, airports, Wi-Fi at Internet cafés, etc.).</p>

<h2>Bringing Danger Back Into the Firewall Perimeter</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">These threats signify a danger far beyond the scope of the individual laptop. Now, once the laptop had returned to its base and is connected to the enterprise network, intrusive code may proceed to use the laptop as a platform for breaching corporate security. What used to be a perfectly solid protection needs reviewing, urgently.</p>

<h2>Result of Lack of Protection Oustide the Firewall Perimeter</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Relying solely on the best of breed software on the laptop is insufficient due to:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Operating System inherent vulnerabilities. By definition, security software running on Windows is subject to inherent Windows vulnerabilities, effectively exposing personal firewall and antivirus applications to malicious content attacks.</li>
 	<li>Unknown threats. The security software can only defend against known threats. By the time these threats are added to the knowledge base, it may be too late.</li>
 	<li>Immediate damage. Malicious content executes directly on the platform to be protected, rather than on a security appliance designed to filter the content and serve as a buffer.</li>
 	<li>Managing security level. Making sure all the computers have the latest security updates installed as well as enforcing a unified security policy are two rather difficult tasks to keep in hand. When the computers themselves are at the front line, these security weaknesses can be disastrous to the entire network. In other words, it’s “all or nothing”, either the entire network is secure or nothing is secured.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where to Look for 360° Anywhere Protection</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consequently, many organizations are driven to adopt tough security policies prohibiting most wireless networking options. The downside of this: significantly limited user productivity and remote computing freedom. Otherwise, they impose strict, costly and difficult to enforce cleansing procedures for laptops that return from the “field”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Having seen this need and worked on a solution involving keeping this newfound freedom, TSplus can proudly present Advanced Security.</b></p>

<h2>Best Line of Defence, In and Out of the Firewall Perimeter</h2>

A growing number of company IT security services have decided to place computers behind a robust security gateway, usually a dedicated security appliance or a cloud service, to counteract the current weaknesses in laptop security. Indeed, as soon as staff work away, accessing corporate files and information remotely, security becomes a complicated matter. Or at least it did, since solutions are at hand to protect these remote workers and their companies, wherever they may choose to work. <strong><a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> and its companion software form such a solution. Find out all it takes to setup for secure remote work outside the safe zone.</strong>
<h2>Hardware Security Gateway to Secure Remote Infrastructures</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">First, is the hardware solution. These set-ups are equipped with hardened operating systems that do not have security holes, “back-doors”, or unsecured layers. They are designed with a single purpose, to provide security.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When these security appliances are hardware-based and not software-based, they provide the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>They cannot be uninstalled. Security attacks often start by targeting the security software, mainly by trying to uninstall it or to stop its activity. On the other hand, a software-based security solution, as any software program, includes an uninstall option that can be targeted.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">So in contrast to a software solution, appliance-based security cannot be uninstalled as it is hard-coded into the hardware.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>They have non-writable memory. Hardware-based solutions manage the memory in a restricted and controlled manner. Security appliances can prohibit access to their memory, providing greater protection against attacks on the security mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Added Bonuses of a Hardware Plus Software Setup for Secure Remote Work Outside the Safe Zone</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The use of hardware allows the combination of a comprehensive set of security solutions in a single device. Indeed, it is always possible to add software solutions which will come to complement the hardware defence.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, the certain tension between users and IT managers over their computing freedom can be overcome via hardware.</p>

<h2>Settling Differences - Setup for Secure Remote Work Outside the Safe Zone</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">On one hand, users want to have complete freedom when using their computers, while on the other hand, IT managers try to enforce security policies (e.g. banning the use of social networks and forums or of P2P software).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By setting up a secure infrastructure, IT managers can solve this conflict to a great extent.</p>

<h2>Cloud and Dematerialised Hosting for Cybersecurity Outside the Safe Zone</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nevertheless, as Internet progresses and much of what we do moves into the cloud, this is evolving. It used to be that with software, policy was part of the laptop or computer. With modern remote access possibilities and cloud hosting, security policy can be enforced directly on the Web. Consequently, just as with a hardware set-up, the user has complete freedom inside a safe corporate computing environment. The difference is that the whole of this is over HTTPS, via set user credentials, and it is vetted by software that remains safely behind company or provider Web-security walls.</p>

<h2>TSplus Remote Access for a Safer Distant Working Experience</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Via the <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/">TSplus Gateway Portal</a>, users remotely access their office desktop session just as they may at the office, using their single sign-on credentials. 2FA and Advanced Security two perfect add-ons for the situation we have been discussing. No matter from where or from what device your users log in, company data and files remain safe, benefit from our all-round protection.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on a Setting Up For Secure Remote Work Outside the Safe Zone</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Depending on company requirements, you can have one or the other solution, or the best of both.&nbsp; No wonder IT and security staff are moving away from old habits to provide corporate level security for laptops and any other device operating outside the safe roaming office environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The only thing left is to decide between a dedicated appliance or a cloud solution, which can still be self-hosted or on subscription. Both set-ups can hold all of the best of breed security software and are therefore able to re-introduce the two lines of defence enjoyed by office-based PCs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By introducing a security gateway, should security be breached, the damage stops at the gateway.</p>

Are you a customer who wants total control of your web site administrative functions and haven't already taken a look at unmanaged web hosting services? Then you should find they give you complete remote control administration over your servers. The technical side of the server can be controlled by a designated administrator that you pick to handle your web information if you want to delegate such tasks.
<h2>Expertise to Use Un-Managed Host Services</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It really is essential to have a technical person to install and manage servers if you yourself don’t have the expertise. Indeed, as the customer, you will be responsible for maintaining the server environment. That’s why unmanaged servers are recommended for individuals and businesses with server administration resources.</p>

<h2>Potential of Using Unmanaged Host Services</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To go the whole way, there is also a case for developing applications and controlling them without going through external technical support personnel on the managed server side. Unmanaged servers are usually used by companies developing real time response systems or applications to sell over the Internet or on behalf of other companies. In this context, our <a href="https://tsplus.net/">array of software</a> will readily be put to good use.</p>

<h2>Scalability of Unmanaged Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unmanaged servers allow you to add extra hard disk space to increase your space capacity. Many computer companies sell physical servers that are configured for unmanaged hosting applications. Software programs have evolved making is easier than ever to not only run an office network but also handle web server and development applications. <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> software was developed to serve these uses. Especially when backed by Advanced Security and Server Monitoring for example.</p>

<h2>Choosing Between Using Managed and Unmanaged Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Small businesses that don’t need a server on site to deal with administrative web packages should go with managed host packages. These provide support, whether practical assistance or administrative. Managed applications should suit just fine because they will spread the costs of maintaining and upgrading all parts of the system and set-up. Indeed, they will perform these services for you.</p>

<h2>Weighing Everything in the Balance Between Managed and Unmanaged Host Services</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Depending on what you are running, unmanaged servers need regular to constant upgrades of software and hardware which could be costly to your small business. At least in time and attention. Remember that Microsoft alone releases large amount of security updates, which if they aren't applied can be a cause for security breaches of your system, and they are likely to not be the only type of software you run.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important to put this in the balance opposite the subscription cost of managed servers if you intend to make an informed choice between the two options. If you are a small firm that develops in house web applications, chances are that unmanaged servers work out a good choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In any case, it can be worthwhile calling on an IT consultant regardless of your company size. They can draw up an IT plan to see if you need this type of hosting service or not.</p>

<h2>Remote Access Within the Use of Managed and Unmanaged Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Access is a tool that can be used in both managed and unmanaged contexts to publish applications and make them available remotely, whether internally to a company or over the Internet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a whole, our software suite works together to build a working toolbox that can be used in-house or for a software business. Just the same, separate items can be installed and used individually to meet specific requirements. Scalable and adaptable to size, use and budget according to your company needs.</p>

One of the first choices, when it comes to hosting a website, is whether to use collocated servers or dedicated servers. In fact, if you haven’t had to take this sort of decision before, you may not even know the difference between the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<h2>Servers - Colocated or Dedicated?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are several differences to be found between collocated servers and dedicated servers. What’s more, the different functions of each may make one option more or less attractive to a website developer or to another agent. Many companies will offer their customers the use of either a dedicated or collocated server. Several advantages and disadvantages will become evident with each type of service. Ultimately, the decision generally rests with the website developer according to their needs for the website.</p>

<h2>Differences between Colocated Servers and Dedicated Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The main difference between a collocated server and a dedicated server is the ownership of the server. With a dedicated server, the user is provided with exclusive use of a server that is owned by another entity, generally the hosting provider A collocated server is owned by the user and is housed in a rental space along with the servers of many other companies and individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In other words, with a dedicated server you rent the server and with a collocated server, you rent the space to house your server. Each option is more cost effective than purchasing and housing the server on your own, but there are major differences in what you can and cannot do with the equipment.</p>

<h2>Dedicated Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With a dedicated server, you have exclusive access to the server. Therefore, you can place any software, content, or applications on the server. Your choice is the key. Websites that use dedicated servers also have a higher reliability and can handle a great deal more traffic than sites that are hosted on shared servers. Moreover, with a dedicated server, any issues that arise with the server are the responsibility of the company from whom you are renting the server. Please, note that this could be a good or bad thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the biggest disadvantages to a dedicated server is that you only own the data on the server, not the server itself. Consequently, if you are dissatisfied with the service provided, you may have little recourse until your contract expires.</p>

<h2>Colocated Server</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then you have collocated servers. One of their biggest advantages is that you own and have full access to the server at any time. The applications can be run from a remote location while the server is housed in a secure facility with an uninterruptible power supply, internet connectivity, and increased security features. Additionally, opting for the server to be collocated frees up valuable space on business premises, that would be needed to house the server. Thus, it allows co-leasers to split the cost of utilities between all those with servers housed in the zone or building. Yet, bear in mind that the biggest disadvantage to collocated servers is that all issues, maintenance, and needed repairs to the server must be handled on your own.</p>

<h2>Choosing between Colocated and Dedicated Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Which one do I need for my business? The answer depends mostly on your budget and the technical expertise you have available in-house. If you are a small company that is unable to handle the cost of collocation or to provide the necessary IT experience, then dedicated servers are likely to be your best choice. On the other hand, if you have the budget and the know-how, you may not hesitate long before opting for co-located servers and the freedom they bring.</p>

<h2>Remember to Monitor Your Colocated and Dedicated Servers -  in All Simplicity</h2>

What\u2019s more, the different functions of each may make one option more or less attractive to a website developer or to another agent. Many companies will offer their customers the use of either a dedicated or collocated server. Several advantages and disadvantages will become evident with each type of service. Ultimately, the decision generally rests with the website developer according to their needs for the website.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Differences between Colocated Servers and Dedicated Servers<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The main difference between a collocated server and a dedicated server is the ownership of the server. With a dedicated server, the user is provided with exclusive use of a server that is owned by another entity, generally the hosting provider A collocated server is owned by the user and is housed in a rental space along with the servers of many other companies and individuals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In other words, with a dedicated server you rent the server and with a collocated server, you rent the space to house your server. Each option is more cost effective than purchasing and housing the server on your own, but there are major differences in what you can and cannot do with the equipment.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Dedicated Servers<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With a dedicated server, you have exclusive access to the server. Therefore, you can place any software, content, or applications on the server. Your choice is the key. Websites that use dedicated servers also have a higher reliability and can handle a great deal more traffic than sites that are hosted on shared servers. Moreover, with a dedicated server, any issues that arise with the server are the responsibility of the company from whom you are renting the server. Please, note that this could be a good or bad thing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the biggest disadvantages to a dedicated server is that you only own the data on the server, not the server itself. Consequently, if you are dissatisfied with the service provided, you may have little recourse until your contract expires.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Colocated Server<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Then you have collocated servers. One of their biggest advantages is that you own and have full access to the server at any time. The applications can be run from a remote location while the server is housed in a secure facility with an uninterruptible power supply, internet connectivity, and increased security features. Additionally, opting for the server to be collocated frees up valuable space on business premises, that would be needed to house the server. Thus, it allows co-leasers to split the cost of utilities between all those with servers housed in the zone or building. Yet, bear in mind that the biggest disadvantage to collocated servers is that all issues, maintenance, and needed repairs to the server must be handled on your own.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Choosing between Colocated and Dedicated Servers<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Which one do I need for my business? The answer depends mostly on your budget and the technical expertise you have available in-house. If you are a small company that is unable to handle the cost of collocation or to provide the necessary IT experience, then dedicated servers are likely to be your best choice. On the other hand, if you have the budget and the know-how, you may not hesitate long before opting for co-located servers and the freedom they bring.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Remember to Monitor Your Colocated and Dedicated Servers -  in All Simplicity<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Whichever choice you make, servers need surveillance. TSplus, as a software developer, has built <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/server-monitoring\/\">Server Monitoring<\/a> as a simple, efficient and affordable tool for server surveillance.

		<p><b>The Myth of Web Based Applications Services:</b></p><p>Some staffing companies consider web-based systems and services. It is important to weigh up “Why web based?”. Most often, this will bring up more questions and some pre-conceived ideas. Typically: “Isn’t that what everybody’s doing?” or “I don’t want to make a large investment.”, “Web-based services are cheaper.” or even “I don’t want to be responsible for my own network.”</p><h2>Misunderstanding of Web-based Services</h2><p style="text-align: left;">This underlines a general misunderstanding of web services platforms as well as what its relative strengths and weaknesses happen to be. When choosing a staffing software system or any other major item of software for your business, it is important to understand how the system is going to be used. The aim is to select a platform that will deliver the best and most cost-efficient results. Be it hosted in the cloud or not, on your premises or elsewhere.</p><h2>Discussion around Web Hosted Services</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Following is a quick discussion of some of the main benefits touted by web-based systems. Next, we’ll see some of the compromises one will have to bear in order to use them. Then, we can wrap up with a review of the principal alternative and our very own solution: <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a>.</p><h2>Web based systems can be run from anywhere that has access to the internet.</h2><p style="text-align: left;">This is true, but it is not the exclusive domain of web-based systems. Pretty much any system can be run using the internet as a connection conduit. Microsoft has included a capability in their Windows operating system called Terminal Services that enables users to access applications on the Windows network via the internet.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Conclusion: No clear-cut advantage.</p><h2>I won’t have to maintain my own network.</h2><p style="text-align: left;">This is only true if every user has their own individual internet connection. In most offices, many users connect to the same telecom line. In order for everyone to access the shared resource, a network must exist. Most likely, staff will need file sharing, e-mail and print services locally. Therefore, some network administration will be required.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, firewalls, virus protection and some kind of local expertise are crucial. Finally, most importantly, a back-up routine is still required.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Conclusion: No advantage.</p><p>You still have to do all the network admin stuff anyway. In addition, there’s someone between you and one of your most valuable assets: your data. Should a dispute ever arise, someone would be in a position to cut your company off from its life’s blood.</p><h2>The user interface is easier to learn since it’s like a web page.</h2><p style="text-align: left;">With any system the designer has to create the methods and workflows. They will be forced to use conventions, abbreviations, icons and other devices as they attempt to get the most functionality per inch of available screen space. The user will still have to learn how the system works and get used to its specific paths. All the more, while it is true that many people are familiar with how to navigate web pages, the same can be said of Windows applications. In fact, Windows programs generally adhere more rigorously to a set of standards than web-based programs tend to.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Conclusion: No advantage. There will still be a learning curve and training requirements to effectively use such software.</p><h2>What they’re not telling you:</h2><p style="text-align: left;">1. Web based systems run through a web browser. This means that the user interface is constrained by the limits of the browser itself. The browser will limit the number of records that can be open at a time, will force more data integrity responsibility on the user and often users can experience long delays.</p><p style="text-align: left;">2. Web based systems, or just about any system delivered through an ASP are significantly more expensive. This is a classic rent vs. buy decision. If your company has 10 system users and you have to pay $199 per month per user, that’s a $1,990 per month outlay. This is the equivalent of purchasing a $60,000 system (based on a 36 months, $1 buyout lease). There aren’t many systems that charge $6,000 per user. This is exorbitantly expensive.</p><h2>The best alternative to Web Based Services:</h2><p style="text-align: left;">This is easy. Windows based (client/server) systems answer all the questions raised above. These systems can be delivered to diverse and remote users via the web. They also run on the same basic network (with the addition of SQL Server) that satisfies the rest of our needs. Additionally, they have exceedingly rich user interfaces – generally offering many more features. Finally, they are easy to learn and usually out-perform systems running from the web. All in all, they also provide much more bang for the buck.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Having your database in your office isn’t necessarily bad, as it remains under your control. What’s more, these systems are generally more mature. Thus, they offer a far greater range of features as well as being typically more stable. All this translates into a better, more cost-effective computing experience for your company. After all, you’re not in this to support the technology; you expect the technology to support you.</p><h2>TSplus Remote Access the Affordable Way to Publish your Apps to the Web</h2><p style="text-align: left;"><b>TSplus software make use of Microsoft’s inherent Terminal Services or RDP.

Microsoft has included a capability in their Windows operating system called Terminal Services that enables users to access applications on the Windows network via the internet.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion: No clear-cut advantage.<\/p><h2>I won\u2019t have to maintain my own network.<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is only true if every user has their own individual internet connection. In most offices, many users connect to the same telecom\u00a0line. In order for everyone to access the shared resource, a network must exist. Most likely, staff will need file sharing, e-mail and print services locally. Therefore, some network administration will be required.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Additionally, firewalls, virus protection and some kind of local expertise are crucial. Finally, most importantly, a back-up routine is still required.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion: No advantage.<\/p><p>You still have to do all the network admin stuff anyway. In addition, there\u2019s someone between you and one of your most valuable assets: your data. Should a dispute ever arise, someone would be in a position to cut your company off from its life\u2019s blood.<\/p><h2>The user interface is easier to learn since it\u2019s like a web page.<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With any system the designer has to create the methods and workflows. They will be forced to use conventions, abbreviations, icons and other devices as they attempt to get the most functionality per inch of available screen space. The user will still have to learn how the system works and get used to its specific paths. All the more, while it is true that many people are familiar with how to navigate web pages, the same can be said of Windows applications. In fact, Windows programs generally adhere more rigorously to a set of standards than web-based programs tend to.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion: No advantage. There will still be a learning curve and training requirements to effectively use such software.<\/p><h2>What they\u2019re not telling you:<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">1. Web based systems run through a web browser. This means that the user interface is constrained by the limits of the browser itself. The browser will limit the number of records that can be open at a time, will force more data integrity responsibility on the user and often users can\u00a0experience long delays.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Web based systems, or just about any system delivered through an ASP are significantly more expensive. This is a classic rent vs. buy decision. If your company has 10 system users and you have to pay $199 per month per user, that\u2019s a $1,990 per month outlay. This is the equivalent of purchasing a $60,000 system (based on a 36 months, $1 buyout lease). There aren\u2019t many systems that charge $6,000 per user. This is exorbitantly expensive.<\/p><h2>The best alternative to Web Based Services:<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is easy. Windows based (client\/server) systems answer all the questions raised above. These systems can be delivered to diverse and remote users via the web. They also run on the same basic network (with the addition of SQL Server) that satisfies the rest of our needs. Additionally, they have exceedingly rich user interfaces \u2013 generally offering many more features. Finally, they are easy to learn and usually out-perform systems running from the web.\u00a0All in all, they also provide much more bang for the buck.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Having your database in your office isn\u2019t necessarily bad, as it remains under your control. What\u2019s more, these systems are generally more mature. Thus, they offer a far greater range of features as well as being typically more stable. All this translates into a better, more cost-effective computing experience for your company. After all, you\u2019re not in this to support the technology; you expect the technology to support you.<\/p><h2>TSplus Remote Access the Affordable Way to Publish your Apps to the Web<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>TSplus software make use of Microsoft\u2019s inherent Terminal Services or RDP.

<strong>Our society is maintained by information: information about who we were, who we are, and in some cases who we will become. We live in the Information age, a time where movement of information is faster than physical movement. Some say that we live in a new type of society called an Information Society. In it, the creation, distribution and manipulation of information has become a significant economic and cultural activity.</strong>

<strong>Matthew Lesko, a columnist, made this point clear when he wrote: "Information is the currency of today's world.". The 16th century English statesman, Sir Francis Bacon proclaimed wisely that "knowledge is power". His words echo today in the familiar truism, "information is power." The problem with that is that as a consequence, information also needs protecting and treating with care.</strong>
<h2>Information, Corporate or Private, Needs Protection!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In our lives today we experience how the personal information and corporate data that we keep, that we share and that we lose, moves us through a waxing and waning dance of power and powerlessness. Keep your information safe and you protect your home, your assets, your family and maybe even your life. Share your information and in return you hope to receive valuable goods and services. Lose your information, and the things that you enjoy and love can come crumbling down around you. The same goes in the corporate world, if not worse.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It does not matter whether it is corporate or personal, whether we call it data or information, it remains precious. For those reasons and more, protecting your IT devices and credentials is essential. Especially as with <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus </a>solutions are on hand at affordable prices.</p>

<h2>Where Some of the Dangers Lie Regarding our Information and Data</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today, instead of on paper, most of our private information is stored in electronic format, on hard drives. This technology allows our world to do business as never before imagined. Much of business is faster, less expensive and requires far less labour than even one generation ago. However, throughout history we discover that technological advancement has a price.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pollution and stress invade our environment and often our bodies. Additionally, the loss of certain skills once familiar drives us toward a dangerous dependency. Now high-tech scam artists and thieves prey on victims around the world at the speed of light and neither needs to be awake for the crime to occur. So, with these things in mind, we are moved to the realization that now is the time for each of us to examine the state of, and the danger to, our personal and corporate information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Private and corporate information is vulnerable in two ways. It is vulnerable to loss and to theft. We can compartmentalize storage locations into two frameworks: local computer storage and online storage. These frameworks each have their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<h2>Physical and Virtual Threats to Information Require Combined Defense</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your local, offline information can be stolen by someone breaking into your building, car or wherever you keep your computer. Your data can also be destroyed by a hard drive crash, a fire or flood. However important, can still be difficult and time consuming to keep consistent, daily backups of your hard drive then store them at a location other than the device you are backing up.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although the Cloud does help immensely, there are still misgivings in this area. Moreover, you can never be sure if your computer is at this very moment infected with spyware, adware, trojans, back doors, key loggers, bots or viruses. Sadly, each one is capable of taking control of your computer and sending your valuable, "non-public" information from your hard drive to anywhere in the world. We believe running certain of our <a href="https://tsplus.net/">software products</a> takes a big step towards keeping these threats at bay.</p>

<h2>The Cloud as a Start for Keeping Our Data and Private Information Safe</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many people enjoy keeping notes and documents online. Indeed, every day, people are discovering the convenience of having their thoughts, projects, to-do lists, diaries, customer lists, essays and so much more available from any computer in the world. Business-people, real estate agents, sales-people, house-parents, IT agents, academics, etc. are now getting more work done more efficiently. All this thanks to the wellspring of online document authoring sites and shared access to documents.</p>

<h2>Privacy and the Great WWW - or Who Can See and Use Our Data</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now freed from the task of daily backups and concerns about loss and theft due to an infected computer, only one thing stops online document authoring and storage from being the perfect solution: privacy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unless you see that the address of the website, you’re on begins with the five letters HTTPS, your login ID and password are sent in plain text through unknown places over the Internet. What's more, your documents and everything you type are available to be seen, captured and used by criminals and scam artist devious enough to use that which was supposed to be private.</p>

<h2>HTTPS as Another Good Step Along a Winding Route</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once your information is on the remote computer, do you know how your data is stored? Do you know who has access to it? To paint some worst case scenarios, perhaps it’s a computer technician who think it’s fun to read about other people’s lives and secrets. Or perhaps it’s someone who would sell information on the side to make a little extra money.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You have to trust someone, even though you just can’t know. And unfortunately, not all sites seem to care enough about privacy to seek ways to actively prevent privacy issues from happening. Anyhow, encrypted doesn't mean someone can't listen in or steal the conversation by pretending to be the other party.</p>

<h2>Growing Data Privacy Challenges Met by Increases in Information Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, some websites do try to address these issues. Browsers, email and other all sorts of service or product providers are increasingly secure to meet the growing cyber-security challenges.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, it is becoming easier to securely move your data and documents over the Internet, encrypted by the same methods used by financial institutions and the like to move their sensitive data. If necessary, it is reassuring to be able to encrypt documents at the same level used by governments for top-secret documents.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, unique, multi password systems also exist, such as our very own <a href="https://tsplus.net/two-factor-authentication/">2FA</a> set-up, providing a further layer of security and privacy. With these sort of measures in place, we can rest easier.</p>

<h2>To Conclude on Keeping Our Information Safe and Secure</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>If you have electronic information that must be protected from the two threats to your data: loss and theft, then do take steps to be safe. <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> will be a valuable step along the way and two factor authentication a plus that should not be ignored.</b></p>
<b>
</b>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Other than that, remember (and remind those around you) to be careful with passwords and choose them well to avoid them being easy to crack. Finally, be mindful of where you leave any data that needs to remain private as well as which sites you visit.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

All this thanks to the wellspring of online document authoring sites and shared access to documents.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Privacy and the Great WWW - or Who Can See and Use Our Data<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now freed from the task of daily backups and concerns about loss and theft due to an infected computer, only one thing stops online document authoring and storage from being the perfect solution: privacy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Unless you see that the address of the website, you\u2019re on begins with the five letters HTTPS, your login ID and password are sent in plain text through unknown places over the Internet. What's more, your documents and everything you type are available to be seen, captured and used by criminals and scam artist devious enough to use that which was supposed to be private.<\/p>\n\n<h2>HTTPS as Another Good Step Along a Winding Route<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once your information is on the remote computer, do you know how your data is stored? Do you know who has access to it? To paint some worst case scenarios, perhaps it\u2019s a computer technician who think it\u2019s fun to read about other people\u2019s lives and secrets. Or perhaps it\u2019s someone who would sell information on the side to make a little extra money.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You have to trust someone, even though you just can\u2019t know. And unfortunately, not all sites seem to care enough about privacy to seek ways to actively prevent privacy issues from happening. Anyhow, encrypted doesn't mean someone can't listen in or steal the conversation by pretending to be the other party.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Growing Data Privacy Challenges Met by Increases in Information Security <\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, some websites do try to address these issues. Browsers, email and other all sorts of service or product providers are increasingly secure to meet the growing cyber-security challenges.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Indeed, it is becoming easier to securely move your data and documents over the Internet, encrypted by the same methods used by financial institutions and the like to move their sensitive data. If necessary, it is reassuring to be able to encrypt documents at the same level used by governments for top-secret documents.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, unique, multi password systems also exist, such as our very own <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/two-factor-authentication\/\">2FA<\/a> set-up, providing a further layer of security and privacy. With these sort of measures in place, we can rest easier.<\/p>\n\n<h2>To Conclude on Keeping Our Information Safe and Secure<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>If you have electronic information that must be protected from the two threats to your data: loss and theft, then do take steps to be safe. <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/\">TSplus Advanced Security<\/a> will be a valuable step along the way and two factor authentication a plus that should not be ignored.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Other than that, remember (and remind those around you) to be careful with passwords and choose them well to avoid them being easy to crack. Finally, be mindful of where you leave any data that needs to remain private as well as which sites you visit.<\/b><\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Managed-Hosting--1024x576.png" alt="Article title, TSplus logo and link, illustrated by picture of typing on a computer screen." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Managed-Hosting--1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Managed-Hosting--300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Managed-Hosting--768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Managed-Hosting--18x10.png 18w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Managed-Hosting-.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" width="800" height="450">								</a>
When an individual first begins to create web pages on the internet for their company or to start a business, one of the issues that will arise is how to host the website. There are several options available, but the one that many businesses choose is managed hosting. Companies choose managed hosting for a variety of reasons. Let's have a look at some of the many benefits to managed hosting that make it a very attractive option for many.
<p style="text-align: left;">There are a number of providers that offer managed hosting. Generally, the fees for each can vary considerably due to the features and options that the company provides. So, what are the benefits of managed hosting?</p>

<h2>Benefit of Managed Hosting - Strength in Numbers Cause Spread Costs to Be Lower</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the biggest benefits of managed hosting is the price of the service. A large proportion of companies that offer managed hosting can offer services and bandwidth at a much lower price than many businesses may be able to obtain on their own. This is because the cost and the amount of available bandwidth is spread among large numbers of clients. Some of these may need a relatively small amount of bandwidth to operate their websites and others much more, but that common pool means cost is spread.</p>

<h2>Shared Managed Hosting and Dedicated Servers as a Benefit of Managed Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Using managed hosting also saves each individual business from having to purchase and maintain additional equipment in order to host their websites. This includes servers and networking software. Some managed hosting companies will also allow businesses to place their website on a dedicated server for a higher monthly or annual fee. This option is commonly chosen by companies that need a great amount of bandwidth for their sites to run effectively.</p>

<h2>Additional Features Increase Benefits of Managed Hosting for Customers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is another reason that many individuals find managed hosting to be an attractive option. That is because of the additional features that are included in the service package. Many managed hosting companies offer the individuals using their service increased security and monitoring services that prevent a host of issues. Type of problems curtailed by the provider can range from the spread of viruses to unauthorized access to the stealing of customer’s personal information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Purchasing security software and equipment to constantly monitor for these issues can be costly for the average consumers. Yet managed hosting companies can provide these services at a fraction of the costs since it is split between many.</p>

<h2>Final Benefit of Managed Hosting: Constant Power Supply Plus Back-up Facilities</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Managed hosting companies can also provide an uninterrupted power supply and data backup features to ensure that the website will run smoothly and without interruption for a vast majority of the time. In fact, many of these companies can provide an average up time of better than 95%. This is practically unachievable if the business is hosting the website themselves. Indeed, housing a generator on business premises is not a possibility open to all.</p>

<h2>Monitoring Servers Benefits Both Self-Hosted and Managed Hosting</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Overall, monitoring will remain key to your server use and any websites. And this, whether you opt for self-hosted or for managed servers. The importance of monitoring will especially apply if you need to access any of your network over the Internet. <b>So, let us present to you <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a>, a handy, user-friendly and ergonomic monitoring tool to keep an eye on your servers and websites.

		<strong>Contrary to popular belief computer users are at a great risk of being invaded by spyware and other surveillance software via remote areas.  Normally, people were unconcerned with surveillance software because it was assumed it could only be installed with physical access.</strong><h2>Surveillance and Spyware Software - Remote Versions Advertised</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Several surveillance software and spyware providers are now advertising remote deployment software. These can be installed from any computer anywhere and the information collected from the subject is sent back to the intruder’s computer.</p>
<h2>Insidious Not Destructive Surveillance Spyware Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bear in mind that spyware or surveillance software can easily be slipped into someone’s computer through an email attachment, greeting card or simply by visiting a web site. Instead of destroying a computer’s hardware as do Trojans and viruses, surveillance software works silently. Indeed, it will trawl through the computer to gather personal information to send to a third party. Many users have thought in the past that such software could not be installed without physical access but remote deployment spyware is on the rise.</p>
<h2>Various inroads for Surveillance or Spyware Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote deployment of surveillance software through email often works by sending an attachment that often looks like a screen saver. But once it is opened, the user’s device is immediately infected. Surveillance software is remotely deployed through web sites by the browser displaying a message. Now, if the user accepts, usually unbeknownst to themselves, a malicious file is activated which contains spyware.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Snoops also send surveillance software through greeting cards, PDF attachments and the like. The intruder sends an electronic document. They may impersonate a colleague, supplier, provider, competitor, client. When the user views the e-card or other they are inadvertently infected with spyware.</p>
<h2>Damage and Dangers of Surveillance and Spyware Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">These methods of remotely installing spyware onto someone’s computer work well because users are unaware that the installation is possible silently, without physical access. Firewalls, anti-virus and adware scanners are incapable of detecting and removing these surveillance applications. To rid your computer of the spyware you must download a tool designed specifically for detecting and removing surveillance software.</p>
<h2>Guarding Against Surveillance and Spyware Software with TSplus Advanced Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Securing your corporate servers and remote work infrastructure is a delicate matter to leave unsolved. We believe <strong>Advanced Security</strong> is the most powerful set of security features ever combined, offering 360 protection to your remote IT setup. It features both guards against external attacks and management of when logins and published applications are used, but also much more.</p>

		IT agents all over the world have been providing support, updates, and other fixes remotely for many years. This has accelerated with the recent pandemic but the trend was already well established before any lock-downs confined whole societies to work from home and cut contact with anyone. Indeed, IT provides something invisible and constant to countless organisations, businesses and more, planet-wide. In all honesty, all probably needed 24-7 365 attention from the word go. <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus </a>saw this need a while ago so offers unattended access as a feature of its Remote Support software.<h2>A Need for Remote Control and Support Attended and Unattended Remote Control</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Hospitals, universities, governments, businesses and corporations of all kinds, members of the general public... The list of potential people and their devices that could need support is endless.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Regardless of where and why, it is clear that remote control and support of devices is quintessential to the way whole parts of our modern society functions nowadays. Technicians are able to maximise their time and efficiency thanks to remote support possibilities. They can access any device anywhere thanks to remote connectivity and to the functionalities of the software that makes their work possible.</p><h2>A Need for Attended and Unattended Remote Control</h2><p style="text-align: left;">In addition to that, it is worth noting that IT glitches don't wait for the workday to happen and that some updates, upgrades, fixes and similar tasks take a very long time. Both of these factors alone make a case for unattended support to be available in parallel to attended support.</p><h2>Using Attended and Unattended Remote Control</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Attended support and control is great when the agent and the client need to be in conversation about the work the agent needs to carry out. Such occasions will include an IT problem, an issue with the client's device which they need to describe to the agent. It may be they need to perform particular tasks and have given the agent the remit to put things in place and prepare their device to do this.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, it can be very interesting to use attended remote control during training sessions, specially as TSplus Remote Support lets several agents view the same screen. Interaction thus becomes possible in a new ways for demonstration purposes. For instance, it is useful to show other members of a team particular actions which they will need to repeat or the possibilities of a new piece software.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Unattended remote support, on the other hand, can involve silent upgrades while staff are away from their device. Agents may fix issues with servers or other devices either overnight or out of hours, or simply at a set time when the users are otherwise engaged.</p><h2>Specifics of Setting up Attended Access with TSplus</h2><p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Support has been developed to be as user-friendly as possible while remaining affordable, secure and featuring the actions support agents generally expect of such software. Setup is straight-forward, requiring a rapid download and run of the console for either agent or end-user. Then the end-user needs to share their ID and password so the agent can enter them and establish the connection.</p><p style="text-align: left;">All this takes mere moments and can be done directly if needed, or the agent can log in for a more personalised experience. Indeed, TSplus Remote Support software can bear your company name and logo, colours and branding, and each agent can add their title and photo as well as simplify the console appearance at the client end. All this makes for reassuring and simple interactions between parties and for a more serene overall use.</p><h2>Specifics of Setting up Unattended Access with TSplus Remote Support</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Amongst the tools available to agents are their list of remote devices. They can add remote devices to their unattended machines and so long as the end-user leaves the connection open and available, interventions are possible anytime. It is worth noting that, to end a connection, all the client needs to do is close their Remote Support window.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Of course, the end-device needs to remain on for the unattended connection to stay live. Remote control is then possible while the end-user is away from their machine, either for meetings, break or not at work.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Other than adding or removing devices from their list, agents can send command prompts, an essential in some instances. Being able to work on an unattended device has the advantages of not needing to lock mouse or keyboard input from the remote device and of not breaking end-user workflow. Moreover, it makes it possible for agents to spread workloads and schedule their work conveniently, thus avoiding bottle-necks and overworking being followed by times of waiting for the next mission.</p><h2>Team Possibilities with Attended and Unattended Remote Support and Control</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Above, I mentioned how teams could make good use of controlling screens, mouse and keyboard remotely for demonstration and training purposes. Equally, one agent may call colleagues in on a particular intervention for joint assistance. They may show a new recruit what can be done and how to proceed. Another occasion may include discovering new software or a recent fix.</p><p style="text-align: left;">With a few select features, the potential is as broad as agents and clients will make it. Whichever way, the ergonomics and ease-of-use of TSplus software makes the experience all the simpler.</p><h2>TSplus Solution for Remote Support and Control</h2><p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> is a simple secure and affordable remote control solution with all the scalability and versatility to get the job done from small freelance businesses to corporations.</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;"><b>Come and try our software for 15 days for free or read more before you buy.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

This has accelerated with the recent pandemic but the trend was already well established before any lock-downs confined whole societies to work from home and cut contact with anyone. Indeed, IT provides something invisible and constant to countless organisations, businesses and more, planet-wide. In all honesty, all probably needed 24-7 365 attention from the word go. <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">TSplus <\/a>saw this need a while ago so offers unattended access as a feature of its Remote Support software.","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>A Need for Remote Control and Support Attended and Unattended Remote Control<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Hospitals, universities, governments, businesses and corporations of all kinds, members of the general public... The list of potential people and their devices that could need support is endless.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Regardless of where and why, it is clear that remote control and support of devices is quintessential to the way whole parts of our modern society functions nowadays. Technicians are able to maximise their time and efficiency thanks to remote support possibilities. They can access any device anywhere thanks to remote connectivity and to the functionalities of the software that makes their work possible.<\/p><h2>A Need for Attended and Unattended Remote Control<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to that, it is worth noting that IT glitches don't wait for the workday to happen and that some updates, upgrades, fixes and similar tasks take a very long time. Both of these factors alone make a case for unattended support to be available in parallel to attended support.<\/p><h2>Using Attended and Unattended Remote Control<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Attended support and control is great when the agent and the client need to be in conversation about the work the agent needs to carry out. Such occasions will include an IT problem, an issue with the client's device which they need to describe to the agent. It may be they need to perform particular tasks and have given the agent the remit to put things in place and prepare their device to do this.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Additionally, it can be very interesting to use attended remote control during training sessions, specially as TSplus Remote Support lets several agents view the same screen. Interaction thus becomes possible in a new ways for demonstration purposes. For instance, it is useful to show other members of a team particular actions which they will need to repeat or the possibilities of a new piece software.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Unattended remote support, on the other hand, can involve silent upgrades while staff are away from their device. Agents may fix issues with servers or other devices either overnight or out of hours, or simply at a set time when the users are otherwise engaged.<\/p><h2>Specifics of Setting up Attended Access with TSplus<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">TSplus Remote Support has been developed to be as user-friendly as possible while remaining affordable, secure and featuring the actions support agents generally expect of such software. Setup is straight-forward, requiring a rapid download and run of the console for either agent or end-user. Then the end-user needs to share their ID and password so the agent can enter them and establish the connection.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">All this takes mere moments and can be done directly if needed, or the agent can log in for a more personalised experience. Indeed, TSplus Remote Support software can bear your company name and logo, colours and branding, and each agent can add their title and photo as well as simplify the console appearance at the client end. All this makes for reassuring and simple interactions between parties and for a more serene overall use.<\/p><h2>Specifics of Setting up Unattended Access with TSplus Remote Support<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Amongst the tools available to agents are their list of remote devices. They can add remote devices to their unattended machines and so long as the end-user leaves the connection open and available, interventions are possible anytime. It is worth noting that, to end a connection, all the client needs to do is close their Remote Support window.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, the end-device needs to remain on for the unattended connection to stay live. Remote control is then possible while the end-user is away from their machine, either for meetings, break or not at work.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Other than adding or removing devices from their list, agents can send command prompts, an essential in some instances. Being able to work on an unattended device has the advantages of not needing to lock mouse or keyboard input from the remote device and of not breaking end-user workflow. Moreover, it makes it possible for agents to spread workloads and schedule their work conveniently, thus avoiding bottle-necks and overworking being followed by times of waiting for the next mission.<\/p><h2>Team Possibilities with Attended and Unattended Remote Support and Control<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Above, I mentioned how teams could make good use of controlling screens, mouse and keyboard remotely for demonstration and training purposes. Equally, one agent may call colleagues in on a particular intervention for joint assistance. They may show a new recruit what can be done and how to proceed. Another occasion may include discovering new software or a recent fix.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With a few select features, the potential is as broad as agents and clients will make it. Whichever way, the ergonomics and ease-of-use of TSplus software makes the experience all the simpler.<\/p><h2>TSplus Solution for Remote Support and Control<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-support\/\">TSplus Remote Support<\/a> is a simple secure and affordable remote control solution with all the scalability and versatility to get the job done from small freelance businesses to corporations.<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Come and try our software for 15 days for free or read more before you buy.<\/b><\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

Remote working, remote access, remote control, remote support, are all facets of work a large portion of the population has discovered over the past 3 years. Where Remote View is concerned, it is a great description of what <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-work/">TSplus Remote Work</a> and similar software do. They make it possible to see our workstation while we are out of office for any reason.

That means we can pick things up exactly where we left them, mid-sentence even, never mind the time-zone, languages spoken, altitude or temperature of the place we may find ourselves. Tempting, right.
<h2>How to Remote View - What is it?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It could be described as a secure tunnel into the office workstation. If you have the key to the tunnel door, then you can follow it into that specific device. The process is just the same as how your credentials would let you into your device, were you sat in front of it. Only, it happens over a secure Internet connection. With TSPlus, all this happens over HTML5 with TLS encryption because of how important it is to keep data safe.</p>

<h2>How to Remote View - What does it do?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once logged into the remote device, users can view its screen and work as they would at the office. Each user can open his or her files, modify, process and sort them, access all they would normally access on office premises, up to corporate data and internal networks. Interestingly, this goes on without any of it actually leaving the office since what happens amounts to an image being projected on the local screen.</p>

<h2>How to Remote View - What is isn’t!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote viewing does not mean you have control of the actual device on a system level. Unlike remote support and control software which will let you change, update, fix, repair, this sort of action is not included. The same goes for application publishing, one of the primary features of Remote Access. Where applications are concerned, they will be accessible according to whether they are included on the workstation or not. There is no publishing action required since the desktop is available as a whole. Though, similarly for all these, any of this is only available to the specified person once their credentials have been validated.</p>

<h2>How to Remote View - Prior to Setting Up</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Two questions prior to beginning: Are there any hardware or network prerequisites? How does your system support the software? <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/installation/">Here</a>, you can see our compatibility list for TSplus Remote Access, as part of our Quick-start Guide.</p>

<h2>How to Remote View - Setting Up</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once those checks are done, download and run our Remote Access software program. After the host machine has been restarted, it is time to set&nbsp;up. This is a job best done by administrators or IT staff on the device chosen to be the server which will broker connections. The gateway&nbsp;through which connections will transit, as it may be.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also,&nbsp;each workstation will need to be added, then assigned to users&nbsp;accordingly, etc. It is worth noting you can assign multiple users to specific workstations, enabling staggered use of devices by members of staff working different shifts. Customisation and branding of the Web Portal and any windows that users will open&nbsp;could also be done at this point.</p>

<h2>How to Remote View – Up and Running!</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This done, your staff will simply need their credentials to remote view their work PC desktop over HTML5. Whether for home-working or on business trips, their credentials will give them access to their files and projects and get to work.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is no device restriction due to the use of a Web Portal. Thus,&nbsp;businesses are not forced to provide particular PCs or laptops, though some may prefer to provide company devices anyhow.&nbsp;Teams or users who prefer to use a different OS have the freedom to do so. Other yet will be able to work from their tablet or smartphone.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on How to Remote View</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>No more need for USB sticks, so easily lost. No need even to have corporate cloud storage which may be an additional cost for which you don't want to budget. Thanks to TSplus Remote Access, each worker is able to access to their workstation and to remotely view it from any device anywhere, as long as they have an Internet connexion and their credentials.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>What’s more, their remote experience&nbsp;will still have a company flavour thanks to the branding options. This will provide your teams with a sense of cohesion wherever they are. So why wait? <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">Try Remote Access here.</a></b></p>]]></content:encoded>

The steps to change your password while in a remote desktop session are similar to within your own PC. Yet the differences are big enough that if you don’t know which keys to press, you could draw a complete blank. No need to stay stuck! Here are a few ways to do so, including the run-down of how to change your password with <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a>.
<h2>How to Change Password in Remote Desktop on a PC</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">First things first: whatever device you use, step one is to call up the security options window from which you will be able to choose to change your password.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The likelihood is that you know Ctrl+Alt+Del, which is the usual set of keys is a local command. But this key combination, the one you’d use in a standard “local” session, will not affect anything remote. To open the password-change window for your remote session, you need a combination just a touch different. Indeed, in the RDP environment, you’ll need to hold the End key instead of the Del key. That gives Ctrl+Alt+End to open the required window.</p>

<h2>How to Change Password in Remote Desktop – Steps to Follow</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the security options window pops up, you can choose “change a password”. Double-check the user-name, to make sure you are attempting to change the password to the right account. The following steps are straight forwards since each box tells you what you need to enter. After validating, you should get confirmation that your password has been changed.</p>

<h2>How to Change Password in Remote Desktop with Region-Specific Keyboards</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I can only speak of my own region-specific keyboard: continental European. With these keyboards at least, the second Alt key is not the same as the left Alt key. The AltGr key to the right acts differently to its counterpart for various things. Use it in combination with the End key for the same action as Ctrl+Alt+Del to open your security options window.</p>

<h2>How to Change Password in Remote Desktop on a Laptop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To find the End key on a PC, no issue, look at your keyboard and it’s been in the same corner for generations of keyboards. Try on your laptop and you could get a surprise. Chances are it is hiding, probably under the 1 of your number pad. So, you will need to unlock the pad to use it. And in effect you’ll be pressing down keys Ctrl+Alt+1. Within the window that opens, you can now choose to change your password.</p>

<h2>How to Change Password in Remote Desktop on a Hybrid or Mini Laptop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then, you may have smaller yet. A hybrid tablet-PC, with its removeable keyboard, or a netbook or other miniature laptop, which don’t usually have number pads due to their small size. Then you will probably find the on-screen keyboard could save the day. In fact, a virtual keyboard can be just as useful as on a tablet. You need to call that up by searching “osk” in the remote desktop search box. You can then press and hold Ctrl+Alt on the physical keyboard if you have one and click or tap the on-screen Del key. The security options window will open as above.</p>

<h2>How to Change Password in Remote Desktop if Password Has Expired</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Depending on how passwords are set, it could be your remote desktop password can expire or not. Indeed, administrators can choose to set passwords to “never expire” when they are aware that users are unlikely to connect other than remotely. This is because, to change their password, users need to connect on the physical device. Or someone who has access to would need to do so for them. Therefore, it is preferable to use those settings as default to avoid users finding themselves locked out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, if you do not have direct access to the remote device, the best thing to do is contact your network administrator or their team. They will take care of resetting it on your behalf.</p>

<h2>How to Change Password in Remote Desktop before Password Expires</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here, I’d like to point out that Windows does provide warning that the password is about to expire. The issue with that is that the messages only pop up on opening the RDP session. Since many users only close their session rather than logging out, they won’t get that opening message. That is why it is so frequent for users to be locked out of Remote Desktop. It is possible to force logout via administration settings. Unsurprisingly, network managers regularly resort to this course of action, if only to save having to frequently reset passwords.</p>

<h2>How to Change Password in Remote Desktop from Other OS and Some Other Methods</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To connect from Mac OS, your key-set will be Fn+Ctrl+Option+Backspace (you may have noticed “Option” is the Mac Alt key). Once those keys are pressed, the path should be the same as on a Windows device.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, you could also access the shell and make the change there, using command prompts. There, it is even possible to put things in place for numerous changes. Using PowerShell is another method. It is also called VBS-script. There is also a possibility with Active Directory. Don’t hesitate to contact our support team for further detail on any of these.</p>

<h2>How to Change Password in Remote Desktop with TSplus Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>When using our <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">Remote Access software</a>, the path to follow to change passwords is generally the same, with the Ctrl+Alt+End option being one of the first to consider. You need to bear in mind that an already expired password cannot be changed over HTML5. Instead, the user needs to use the RDP client to connect.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Once more, it is worth noting that in the event of users only ever using HTML5 to connect a good action to take is: set their Windows account password to “never expires” with the parameter “user cannot change password”. You can do this under AdminToolSystem ToolsUsers and Groups.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Finally, TSplus Remote Access does not natively allow users to change their password over the HTML5. As a work-around, our team have developed and published a tool to make it possible. It is available <a href="https://support.tsplus.net/support/solutions/articles/44001240607-how-can-users-change-their-password-">here</a>, in our FAQ.</b></p>

<h2>To Conclude on How to Change Password in Remote Desktop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">So you have a fair few possibilities for changing your password in Remote Desktop sessions. I hope this was a helpful read.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><strong>Remote desktop cyber security is an issue that won’t go away, the fact is clear. So how can remote desktop Web access and any other Internet use be secure? TSplus have developed a protection tool adapted to the specifics of remote connection use such as Remote Access and Remote Support: <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">Advanced Security</a>.</strong></p><h2>Cyber-Security Issues concerning Remote Desktop Web Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Internet has opened many positive possibilities and made them available to countless people around our planet. Sadly, this also has meant that malevolent users have used those same opportunities and their creativity to steal or destroy over the WWW. Whether it is installation of ransomware, malicious use of devices, robbing data and files, once a cyber-criminal has a foothold in a system, they can carry on their infiltration, sometimes un-noticed. It is paramount to avoid their entrance in a network but even more so to be able to stop them in their tracks if they do gain access, in order to avoid further damage and what is called lateral movement.</p>
<h2>Remote Desktop Security When RDP Opens the Doors</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The main Internet security issue comes with the way RDP works. indeed, to make remote connections possible, there has to be a path for data to travel, and doors to let the data through. Basically, that is what ports amount to, they are the place connection requests and data will transit through.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Therefore, it is important for one Port or another to be accessible to outside connections so that the remote connection and information exchanges can take place. Consequently, the exposed port is likely to be open to attack. And this to a much greater measure than any other part of a computer network would ever be.</p>
<h2>Need for Remote Desktop Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Result? The need for protection is a paramount problem to solve if standard RDP and similar remote access is to take place safely. This is where our Advanced Security software comes in with its Brute-force Defender, its known malicious IP blocker and each other well thought out feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nonetheless, it is worth remembering that it is possible to use Remote Access, Remote Support and our other distant software over HTML5 only, curtailing any hardware-related Web connection worry. Some possibilities are different using this connection mode, but safety issues become centred around credentials alone.</p>
<h2>Practical Aspects of Remote Desktop Web Access Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote Desktop software (or services) enables remote access for employees in moments. Yet, it is very important to bear in mind the various security challenges it implies. RDP remains a preferred target for attackers. Additionally, securely configuring RDP holds steps that require technical knowledge and skill. The dangers expose data, systems and corporate networks. Thus, it is paramount security should be properly set up.</p>
<ol>Here are 5 top remote software cyber-security areas to cover:</ol>
<ul>
 	<li>multi-factor authentication;</li>
 	<li>trustworthy security for sessions;</li>
 	<li>adequate protection of systems from the Internet;</li>
 	<li>regular constant patch and vulnerability management;</li>
 	<li>control, monitoring and logging of remote access and any related events.</li>
</ul></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One last thing that has important ramifications is the appropriate control of any authorisations someone may have when they are use a remote connection combined with their rights within the network.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The TSplus team have developed each part of the TSplus software suite with these issues in mind. Hence the specific security features available in Remote Access alone of how Advanced Security completes it for the strongest possible protection on all fronts. Indeed, our remote software uses SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption and TLS certificates.</p>

RDP is short for Remote Desktop Protocol. Microsoft introduced in 1998 and it has since evolved into what it is today. RDP makes remote access possible, enabling users to interact with their PC as though it were on another device. Because of this, it also has other uses, such as support. One question it has raised over the years is that of security. Do you want to know how to secure RDP? Read on to see what <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> can do for your IT set-up.
<h2>Why the Need to Secure RDP?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Badly configured RDP is an inroad for cyber-attacks. Indeed, Remote Desktop Protocol is a networking protocol that enables distant viewing of the PC screen, use of its mouse and keyboard, etc. It communicates via TCP/IP and is designed to be used within a Local Area Network. 3389 is the port generally used to communicate, but that can be modified. The main security issue comes from leaving that port directly open to the Internet, and therefore to any attack.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The thing is, any outside contact opens a port outwards. Also, because of the potential uses of RDP and other remoting solutions, issues relating to users, devices and more all come into play.</p>

<h2>Uses for RDP</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The principal use for RDP are sharing data and applications on servers within a company. This has been extended to remote work in all its forms, support teams, on-call staff and shift workers, and the likes of call-centers and help-desks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">SMBs are highly likely to use RDP since it is native to Windows devices and involves no additional cost as of itself. A typical scenario is that of a company with multiple premises all needing the same info at any given time.</p>

<h2>Steps to Take to Secure Remote Desktop Protocol</h2>
<h2>Top 2 Cyber Security Steps</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">If there were only one fail-safe to implement, it would probably be longer more complex passwords. Gladly, there is no need to narrow things down so radically. Yet, for the sake of network security, this is a good priority. It is worth noting that current recommended minimum security is now: 12 character long passwords which use numbers and special characters, along with higher and lower case letters.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since setting the requirements for passwords lies in the hands of the administrators, it is rapidly done. And the following step is in the same category: 2FA. There are many solutions to set-up multi-factor authentication. TSplus includes <a href="https://tsplus.net/two-factor-authentication/">two factor authentication</a> as part of its bundles or as a stand-alone product. This has to be the best second step in securing RDP.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That said, TSplus hasn't waited for passwords to be strengthened. Rather, our teams have taken the first step by providing TSplus Advanced Security with the Brute Force Defender feature. Its job is to stop brute-force attacks in their tracks, halting any username or password hijacking. Also, it locks your network from networks scanners and hackers.</p>
</li>
<h2>Further Steps to Make RDP Secure</h2>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Firewall. What needs to be said about this step... It is essential? Yes! Do you need to shop around to choose one? Probably not. Why go to any trouble when Windows Defender does the job very nicely and is already native to your devices. What's more, where this list of steps is concerned, TSplus Advanced Security covers every base including this one. The full description of our cyber-protection software can be found <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/features/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another important security step is TLS. It is the way HTTPS communicates so why use anything less secure since it has become standard. Though HTTP still stands, its more secure version has generally superceded it. HTTPS and TLS are good minimum standards to go with.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another practical step admins can take is to limit the number of login attempts and to restrict login times. It is important to set low max attempts. Nonetheless, it needs to be a sensible amount so as to not constantly see passwords being reset. There is a mitigation on this solution though, since it could be used by attackers to narrow down potential user-names. A simple trick would be to restrict login attempts even for non-existant user-names.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Time restrictions are a great tool since they simply stop connections by a particular user outside their set hours. It won't be a possibility over the board. Indeed, certain users need the freedom to access the network at any time. But it will greatly reduce the potential threat zone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Advanced Security comes with one more pin-pointed safe-guard. Homeland is a functionality whereby access can be restricted by country. Therefore, by allowing connections from only the known user-countries, another welcome jump is made towards securing RDP.</p>
</li>
<h2>Patch Management for safer RDP connection</h2>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is common knowledge that patching goes a very long way to keep any devices safer. Security updates are of course designed to diminishing and even cut out specific recognised vulnerabilities and dangers. Regular patch management can too easily be overlooked but should be part of a set surveillance routine. It is thus well worth inserting it into your IT routines.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion on How to Secure RDP</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">For an overall simple and secure experience, it is possible that the first and last step to mention is TSplus. That's what we believe.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Start with the TSplus Web-portal and all the great features included in Advanced Security. Then trust that blocking well over 300 million known malicious IPs is bound to help. Finally add each of the 7 steps covered above.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And yet, there is more to TSplus Advanced Security and how it can keep your network safe. Especially as we haven't talked price at all, while affordability is one of our pillars. <b>Try our it out for free for 15 days or find out more about it or any other of our products from our <a href="https://tsplus.net/">website</a>.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft introduced in 1998 and it has since evolved into what it is today. RDP makes remote access possible, enabling users to interact with their PC as though it were on another device. Because of this, it also has other uses, such as support. One question it has raised over the years is that of security. Do you want to know how to secure RDP? Read on to see what <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/\">TSplus Advanced Security<\/a> can do for your IT set-up.","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>Why the Need to Secure RDP?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Badly configured RDP is an inroad for cyber-attacks. Indeed, Remote Desktop Protocol is a networking protocol that enables distant viewing of the PC screen, use of its mouse and keyboard, etc. It communicates via TCP\/IP and is designed to be used within a Local Area Network. 3389 is the port generally used to communicate, but that can be modified. The main security issue comes from leaving that port directly open to the Internet, and therefore to any attack.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The thing is, any outside contact opens a port outwards. Also, because of the potential uses of RDP and other remoting solutions, issues relating to users, devices and more all come into play.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Uses for RDP<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The principal use for RDP are sharing data and applications on servers within a company. This has been extended to remote work in all its forms, support teams, on-call staff and shift workers, and the likes of call-centers and help-desks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">SMBs are highly likely to use RDP since it is native to Windows devices and involves no additional cost as of itself. A typical scenario is that of a company with multiple premises all needing the same info at any given time.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Steps to Take to Secure Remote Desktop Protocol<\/h2>\n<h2>Top 2 Cyber Security Steps<\/h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If there were only one fail-safe to implement, it would probably be longer more complex passwords. Gladly, there is no need to narrow things down so radically. Yet, for the sake of network security, this is a good priority. It is worth noting that current recommended minimum security is now: 12 character long passwords which use numbers and special characters, along with higher and lower case letters.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since setting the requirements for passwords lies in the hands of the administrators, it is rapidly done. And the following step is in the same category: 2FA. There are many solutions to set-up multi-factor authentication. TSplus includes <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/two-factor-authentication\/\">two factor authentication<\/a> as part of its bundles or as a stand-alone product. This has to be the best second step in securing RDP.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">That said, TSplus hasn't waited for passwords to be strengthened. Rather, our teams have taken the first step by providing TSplus Advanced Security with the Brute Force Defender feature. Its job is to stop brute-force attacks in their tracks, halting any username or password hijacking. Also, it locks your network from networks scanners and hackers.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\n<h2>Further Steps to Make RDP Secure<\/h2>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Firewall. What needs to be said about this step... It is essential? Yes! Do you need to shop around to choose one? Probably not. Why go to any trouble when Windows Defender does the job very nicely and is already native to your devices. What's more, where this list of steps is concerned, TSplus Advanced Security covers every base including this one. The full description of our cyber-protection software can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/features\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Another important security step is TLS. It is the way HTTPS communicates so why use anything less secure since it has become standard. Though HTTP still stands, its more secure version has generally superceded it. HTTPS and TLS are good minimum standards to go with.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Another practical step admins can take is to limit the number of login attempts and to restrict login times. It is important to set low max attempts. Nonetheless, it needs to be a sensible amount so as to not constantly see passwords being reset. There is a mitigation on this solution though, since it could be used by attackers to narrow down potential user-names. A simple trick would be to restrict login attempts even for non-existant user-names.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Time restrictions are a great tool since they simply stop connections by a particular user outside their set hours. It won't be a possibility over the board. Indeed, certain users need the freedom to access the network at any time. But it will greatly reduce the potential threat zone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">TSplus Advanced Security comes with one more pin-pointed safe-guard. Homeland is a functionality whereby access can be restricted by country. Therefore, by allowing connections from only the known user-countries, another welcome jump is made towards securing RDP.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\n<h2>Patch Management for safer RDP connection<\/h2>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is common knowledge that patching goes a very long way to keep any devices safer. Security updates are of course designed to diminishing and even cut out specific recognised vulnerabilities and dangers. Regular patch management can too easily be overlooked but should be part of a set surveillance routine. It is thus well worth inserting it into your IT routines.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Conclusion on How to Secure RDP<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For an overall simple and secure experience, it is possible that the first and last step to mention is TSplus. That's what we believe.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Start with the TSplus Web-portal and all the great features included in Advanced Security. Then trust that blocking well over 300 million known malicious IPs is bound to help. Finally add each of the 7 steps covered above.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And yet, there is more to TSplus Advanced Security and how it can keep your network safe. Especially as we haven't talked price at all, while affordability is one of our pillars. <b>Try our it out for free for 15 days or find out more about it or any other of our products from our <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">website<\/a>.<\/b><\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

Do you know how to black screen in TeamViewer? It is quite straightforward. You probably have the use for this feature. If it has clear uses, there are also alternatives. So, what is in store below? First some of the main reasons and uses for the black screen when remotely controlling another computer. Then the steps to follow to activate and de-activate a black screen. And to finish, a whistle-stop tour of our own TeamViewer alternative software <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a>.
<h2>What is a Black Screen in Remote Control?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A black screen is used to replace any display on a computer device while an agent works. When remotely controlling a screen, there may be a need for privacy, whether data or action related. The black screen serves this purpose in TSplus Remote Support and TeamViewer alike. It acts similarly to a locked sleep screen, since input is generally disabled. Black screen is basically a maintenance screen.</p>

<h2>Why a Black Screen? – Beyond a Screen Saver</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">More than a sleep screen or a screen-saver, a remote support black screen is a security tool. You can activate black screen during all or part of an intervention. It may be the client or the agent who sees the need for it. Then again, it may also be that the device is unattended.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, it can work as a means to lessen the exchange of data when connections are slow. Indeed, no display means less information to send back and forth. In any case, any haphazard interference should be avoided during an agent’s work and private data be protected from prying eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, for example, take an IT intervention done remotely and with no-one attending the remote device. Why use extra energy displaying everything to passers-by? The aim of the black screen remains primarily an uninterrupted work-flow, <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/features/#security-hosting">privacy and data security</a>. Still, it has the added advantage of saving a little on the electricity bill.</p>

<h2>How to Black Screen in TeamViewer - Different Paths to Take</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In TeamViewer, you have the option of going to black screen on the moment. Additionally, there are ways of setting the feature up for any connection to a given device. The spontaneous use of a black screen may be so the user of the remote PC can go on their break while the agent works on. On a long intervention, agent and client may agree on a time to return out of black screen. A recurrent setting would be appropriate for unattended maintenance and out of user hours work.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These would be situations which would free them from initiating individual sessions. What’s more, there is the option to customise the black screen. Imagine, for example, informing onlookers of maintenance or displaying company branding.</p>

<h2>How to Black Screen in TeamViewer - On the Spur of the Moment</h2>
</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">For instantaneous black screen during a TeamViewer session, go to the “Actions” menu and scroll down to “show black screen”. You can set a permanent option for a specific user’s sessions to occur in black screen. This is function is found in the “Extras” menu of the user’s device. Under “Advanced”, modify the “Advanced Connection settings”. Generally, start by ticking “Disable local input”. Then tick “Enable local blackscreen”.</p>

<h2>How to Black Screen in TeamViewer - In Advance</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A second path to do this exists in the agent’s console within the properties of each device. In the “Properties” window for any computer, the “Remote input” menu will open and offer three choices. It is possible to enable or disable remote input or to “Disable remote input and show black screen”.</p>

<h2>How to Undo Black Screen in TeamViewer</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">At any point, the use of Ctrl+Alt+Del or of Cmd+Option+Esc will remove the black screen, enable local input and lock the remote user session. For maintenance to continue, the local user will have to re-enable the agent session so they can input once more.</p>

<h2>TSplus Remote Support for Simple, Secure and Rapid Alternative to TeamViewer - for a Fraction of the Cost</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus has developed simple secure remote control and support software, setting itself as <a href="https://tsplus.net/top-alternatives-to-teamviewer-for-remote-support/">TeamViewer alternative</a>. Remote Support has been designed to be adaptable for best performance. This is attainable whether over state-of-the-art Internet connections or via poor network, low bandwidth and slow Wi-Fi alike. Indeed, the display quality can be modulated to this purpose, thus lightening the data load.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As mentioned, it happens that one use for black screen is to cut down on data flow. By going to black screen the extra data created by the display is neither generated nor sent. We've worked at cutting out that need, choosing adaptability of the display quality instead.</p>

<h2>Replacing Black Screen with TSplus Remote Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote Support has a simple set of features which we saw as essential for remote support and screen control. It can of course be used for fixing, troubleshooting and keeping systems up to date. It's great for training and demonstration purposes too. Where black screen is concerned, Remote Control has the <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/features/">disable input feature</a>. It can be activated and de-activated from both ends.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, we have done without the added black screen feature simply because most keyboards already have a button to this effect. Just the same as there is one to disable the touch-pad. As for PCs, regardless of what secrets their keyboards hold, most monitors have an on-off button. It therefore seemed that an specific feature was unnecessary here.</p>

<h2>TSplus Remote Support Features - Affordability, Efficiency, Simplicity</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Taking close to nothing to do to get started, connection to Remote Support is ultra-quick. You can even host the download on your site for your clients. The handling of TSplus Remote Control is straight-forwards as well. Plus, to add to that, agents can present clients with the lite mode instead of the regular connection window. With only basic connection information this is ideal for its simplicity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Working features start with screen sharing and keyboard and mouse control and include chat and files sharing. Clipboard synchronisation can be enabled or disabled, making copy and paste possible between devices. Multiple agents can attend sessions and there is the option to view any or all of the client monitors. Last but not the least, attended and unattended access and fully encrypted connections were paramount for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many visual aspects of the consoles can be branded and customised. To start with, you can chose your language for the interface. Then you can add your logos and company colours according to your needs.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion: TSplus Solution for How to Black Screen in Remote Support and Control</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> is a simple secure and affordable remote control solution. It has been developed to do the job without frivolities. Black screen seems to us a useful but non-central function since there are other ways to make a screen blank. So for simplicity's sake, no need to double with keyboard and on-off buttons.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Does ergonomic easy-to-use software sound good? Secure and for less than the all-singing all-dancing sort? On our website, you can peruse all of its features and buy <a href="https://tsplus.net/">Remote Support</a> or try it first for 15 days for free.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

When too many RDP sessions remain open, whatever the reasons, sys admins are likely to need to end some of these. Here is how to end, reset, kill etc. an RDP session remotely. Though, bear in mind before setting out that force closing a session, even idle, could cause a loss of data. Due to this, it always good to be able to warn users first, so they can take action. To wrap up, find out how you can modify network settings with <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus </a>and simplify this situation.
<h2>Why Would You Want to End RDP Sessions Remotely?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mainly, RDP sessions should be terminated only if they are lagging or malfunctioning in some way. Indeed, terminating a session surreptitiously will most likely cause its user to loose data. That said, here are some prime reasons to not leave RDP sessions open without purpose.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Quota Exceeded</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are generally only a set amount of live or open RDP connections possible regardless of set-up. If that quota is entirely used up, the server will stop any new connections.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Security</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Open inactive RDP connections are an inroad for security breaches, whether in-house or external. However strong cyber-security may be, there are too many potential threats to take any chances with security.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Bandwidth</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Open connections take up server space and bandwidth at various points. Therefore, leaving them inactive can quickly add up to pointless clogging up of resources. Simply closing the window does not automatically end a session. This highlights a need for users to be informed and settings adjusted in order to avoid this.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Energy Saving</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consequently, hosting open sessions ends up using memory and energy, both when they are active and inactive. Even the smallest savings of memory or bandwidth usage will add up. Together they will be very welcome seeing energy costs of all kinds have steeply risen, snowballing on prices everywhere.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Security</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Security is important enough to get this second mention. It touches on so many areas of IT and networks, whether local or remote, that it cannot be ignored. Data will be all the more secure, the lesser open connections exist. Especially if those connections are open from roaming devices or outside the corporate network.</p>

<h2>How to Find and End RDP Sessions Remotely</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The key is command lines, so you will need both the know-how and the administrative privileges to follow these steps. There are two command lines to run, one after the other.</p>

<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: numbered;">Query Session or QWinSta will provide you with the list of sessions on a given server and their status.</li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you have the list, you will need to make a note of each session ID you mean to terminate. You will need that ID in the second step.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The command amounts to something as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">C:Windowssystem…&gt;qwinsta</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">or C:Usersservername&gt;qwinsta</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">or C:Query Session usernameserver:ServerName</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">where you can search the server, system or user you choose to type. As you guess, according to the information queried, you will pinpoint more or less precise results.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pick out of the list the user or ID you wanted, any hanging sessions, those that need terminating, etc. and make a note. Indeed, the user and ID need to be inserted in the following step.</p>

 	<li>Session Reset can be used, for instance if you are simply dealing with a problematic session. RWinSta or Logoff will serve to end the targeted session or sessions hosted on that particular server.</li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe it needs setting aright but you nonetheless don’t want to end it. Unlike Logoff which will terminate the session entirely, restarting the session should leave it active. Still, remember users risk losing unsaved data in either of these processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To reset the target RDP session run the command with the appropriate ID inserted. It will look something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">C:&gt;reset sessionSessionName|SessionIDserver:ServerName</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">or similar.</p>
</ol>
<h2>How to Force Kill a Session if the Previous Steps Failed</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Generally, the above steps will have ended any session adequately. As nothing is completely infallible, here is one more route. You can still run the command to kill the precise task related to the session. For that, start by killing its logon process, then you can act on the actual process ID.</p>

<h2>Basic Prevention and User Awareness</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Where lagging and hanging sessions are concerned, there is little you can do. But regarding “abandoned” and “idle” sessions, you can make sure users know a couple of basics. Inform everyone that simply closing the window doesn’t end their session. Add that disconnecting is the step for that. You can then explain the linked saving in server resources. Also, point out how this will enable smother networking for everyone. And if energy saving is an argument, then weigh that in too.</p>

<h2>How to Reset Remote Sessions in TSplus Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As far as avoiding users exceeding the number of live sessions is concerned, the easiest solution is settings. By adapting remote session rules, you can control conditions and improve the situation. Here are a few examples of actions admins can take in the Remote Access console.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Choose the length of time during which sessions can remain idle in “Session Management and Local Group Policies (GPO)”. There, you can also choose that any disconnected session will be terminated. Set whether a new logon by the same user will generate a new session, close the previous one or capture it. This function is in the user reconnection section of the same “GPO”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you want further detail about those settings, <a href="https://support.tsplus.net/support/solutions/articles/44000038643-disconnection-of-idle-sessions">click here for our FAQ on How to disconnect Idle Sessions</a>. And last but not least, another layer of safeguard is available with TSplus Advanced Security. With this security tool, you can control times when login is allowed with <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/features/#working-hours">“Working Hours”</a>.</p>

Due to this, it always good to be able to warn users first, so they can take action. To wrap up, find out how you can modify network settings with <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/\">TSplus <\/a>and simplify this situation.<\/p>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>Why Would You Want to End RDP Sessions Remotely?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Mainly, RDP sessions should be terminated only if they are lagging or malfunctioning in some way. Indeed, terminating a session surreptitiously will most likely cause its user to loose data. That said, here are some prime reasons to not leave RDP sessions open without purpose.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>Quota Exceeded<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are generally only a set amount of live or open RDP connections possible regardless of set-up. If that quota is entirely used up, the server will stop any new connections.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>Security<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Open inactive RDP connections are an inroad for security breaches, whether in-house or external. However strong cyber-security may be, there are too many potential threats to take any chances with security.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>Bandwidth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Open connections take up server space and bandwidth at various points. Therefore, leaving them inactive can quickly add up to pointless clogging up of resources. Simply closing the window does not automatically end a session. This highlights a need for users to be informed and settings adjusted in order to avoid this.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>Energy Saving<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Consequently, hosting open sessions ends up using memory and energy, both when they are active and inactive. Even the smallest savings of memory or bandwidth usage will add up. Together they will be very welcome seeing energy costs of all kinds have steeply risen, snowballing on prices everywhere.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>Security<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Security is important enough to get this second mention. It touches on so many areas of IT and networks, whether local or remote, that it cannot be ignored. Data will be all the more secure, the lesser open connections exist. Especially if those connections are open from roaming devices or outside the corporate network.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How to Find and End RDP Sessions Remotely<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The key is command lines, so you will need both the know-how and the administrative privileges to follow these steps. There are two command lines to run, one after the other.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: numbered;\">Query Session or QWinSta will provide you with the list of sessions on a given server and their status.<\/li>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once you have the list, you will need to make a note of each session ID you mean to terminate. You will need that ID in the second step.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The command amounts to something as follows:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">C:\\Windows\\system\u2026&gt;qwinsta<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">or C:\\Users\\servername&gt;qwinsta<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">or C:\\Query Session username\\server:ServerName<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">where you can search the server, system or user you choose to type. As you guess, according to the information queried, you will pinpoint more or less precise results.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Pick out of the list the user or ID you wanted, any hanging sessions, those that need terminating, etc. and make a note. Indeed, the user and ID need to be inserted in the following step.<\/p>\n\n \t<li>Session Reset can be used, for instance if you are simply dealing with a problematic session. RWinSta or Logoff will serve to end the targeted session or sessions hosted on that particular server.<\/li>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Maybe it needs setting aright but you nonetheless don\u2019t want to end it. Unlike Logoff which will terminate the session entirely, restarting the session should leave it active. Still, remember users risk losing unsaved data in either of these processes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To reset the target RDP session run the command with the appropriate ID inserted. It will look something like this:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">C:&gt;reset session\\SessionName|SessionID\\server:ServerName<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">or similar.<\/p><\/ol>\n\n<h2>How to Force Kill a Session if the Previous Steps Failed<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Generally, the above steps will have ended any session adequately. As nothing is completely infallible, here is one more route. You can still run the command to kill the precise task related to the session. For that, start by killing its logon process, then you can act on the actual process ID.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Basic Prevention and User Awareness<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Where lagging and hanging sessions are concerned, there is little you can do. But regarding \u201cabandoned\u201d and \u201cidle\u201d sessions, you can make sure users know a couple of basics. Inform everyone that simply closing the window doesn\u2019t end their session. Add that disconnecting is the step for that. You can then explain the linked saving in server resources. Also, point out how this will enable smother networking for everyone. And if energy saving is an argument, then weigh that in too.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How to Reset Remote Sessions in TSplus Remote Access<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As far as avoiding users exceeding the number of live sessions is concerned, the easiest solution is settings. By adapting remote session rules, you can control conditions and improve the situation. Here are a few examples of actions admins can take in the Remote Access console.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choose the length of time during which sessions can remain idle in \u201cSession Management and Local Group Policies (GPO)\u201d. There, you can also choose that any disconnected session will be terminated. Set whether a new logon by the same user will generate a new session, close the previous one or capture it. This function is in the user reconnection section of the same \u201cGPO\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you want further detail about those settings, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.tsplus.net\/support\/solutions\/articles\/44000038643-disconnection-of-idle-sessions\">click here for our FAQ on How to disconnect Idle Sessions<\/a>. And last but not least, another layer of safeguard is available with TSplus Advanced Security. With this security tool, you can control times when login is allowed with <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/features\/#working-hours\">\u201cWorking Hours\u201d<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>To Conclude on How to Reset RDP Session Remotely<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Above, you have the steps to act in most Windows and Citrix environments. We have designed our software with care for security and fluidity. Indeed, we like software to be secure, efficient, user-friendly and affordable.

		<p>There are some recurrent questions such as this one, which crop up come what may. You could want to know the cost of a Citrix license for any number of reasons. It may be you have a good but expensive experience but are looking for a cheaper alternative! You may have a bad time with it and want to try something new… Or maybe you are new to remote anything and discovering what it all means?</p><p>Anyhow, at <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus</a>, curiosity is welcome so we’ll provide you what we know about the cost of a Citrix license. Then, along the way, we would like to present our simple, secure, efficient and very importantly highly affordable software. We have solutions for remote access, remote support and remote work as well as server and farm monitoring. Last but not least, all are built to function securely.</p><h2>Citrix Licensing – Subscription Based</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Generally, Citrix has opted for a subscription-based licensing policy. Most of its products and services are now billed monthly or yearly, whether they incur a start-off fee or not. Subscriptions are useful to even out cost over a period of time. But, wheigh a subscription and a permanent license comparatively over the long run. It is unlikely that the subscription will turn out cheaper than the one-off sale.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For good or bad, Citrix choose to rent their service on subscription. TSplus licenses, on the other hand, are generally permanent, meaning you pay once and for all. Similarly to Citrix, we do additionally recommend an optional yearly subscription. This is to our Support and Updates service.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The service is calculated as a percentage of your licenses and is detailed in our downloadable price list. We see it as essential as it provides you the latest updates and versions of the software you have purchased. Finally, each of our products can be purchased individually and we have created bundles as well. Our bundles make combining TSplus products easier, quicker and even more affordable. You can go on reading there, if you are already curious to choose a <a href="https://tsplus.net/alternatives-to-citrix/">Citrix alternative</a>.</p>
<h2>Scalable Citrix Licenses Per User or Per Device</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Citrix scale their licenses per user or per device. When you want to estimate the cost of your set-up, you will rapidly be invited to contact their team. Finding out prices without necessarily contacting them is a feat. Our software and bundles, like Citrix licenses, are scalable. You can adapt your order to the size, structure and needs of your company.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have chosen to offer thresholds for certain products and exact quantity for others. Anyhow, our web-shop calculates everything for you, according to what quantity you input. This way, Remote Access is available for 3, 5, 10, 25 or unlimited users. Within our online shop, you can immediately see the price for the provision you choose for your business. We are confident this simple remote solution is within anyone's budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Citrix clients have the possibility of saving money when jointly purchasing Azure Virtual Desktop and Citrix. Also, prices decrease when clients pay for more users. For this example, it was possible to work out a financial cost. Nonetheless, at many other stages, we struggled to obtain precise pricing information. Generally, around their website, we ended up finding out we needed to contact them for a quote.</p>
<h2>Financial Cost Versus True Cost of a Citrix License</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Citrix software solutions and many others incur “invisible” costs on top of their subscription bill. There are infrastructure issues and staff-related questions to consider when changing certain things within a company. Buying new software is no different. Here, main tangible concerns will be regarding hardware and network while primary non-tangibles will be staff and user-related.</p>
<h2>First, Cost For Hardware And IT Set-Up:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Is its security promising? Can you rely on it?</li>
 	<li>Can you keep current devices?</li>
 	<li>Or does choosing Citrix command a company-wide upgrade of PC devices?</li>
 	<li>How about the server set-up and available resources?</li>
 	<li>What about the network (Local and wider)?</li>
 	<li>Sufficient or could there be costly needs to meet?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Second, Cost For Users And Staff:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>What work habits going to need modifying?</li>
 	<li>Or can it be implemented seamlessly?</li>
 	<li>What will the learning curve involve?</li>
 	<li>Who will need training to use the software?</li>
 	<li>Will you need to hire or reassign staff to keep everything in hand?</li>
 	<li>Does the user experience promise to be optimal?</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Much Does a Citrix License Cost Overall?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">All in all, probably more than you'd like. Of course, we know it depends on each company's set-up and needs, both in terms of devices and software capabilities. But when the different outlays are added up, it is no wonder there are numerous searches and articles for Citrix alternatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our remote solutions, including <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">Remote Access</a>, have been developed with care keeping in sight the need for good value for money. Now, an example: prices for Citrix Secure Private Access Standard start at just over $3 per user per month. You have to subscribe for a minimum of 500 users for their site to give you a price. Never mind it being degressive from that stage if you run a Small or Medium business.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So here is what I totted up. Let's say the above Citrix solution would work out as $915 for one year for 25 users. I calculated that going on the basis that some other products can be purchased from "as low as" 25 users. Remote Work licenses for 25 users and the additional Support and Updates service for 3 years amounts to just less than that. $906.25 for three years could leave you able to do wonders with those $915 that you won't spend next year and $915 the following. And seeing how simple to handle our software is, no need for lengthy training, extra staffing, costly set-up or the like.</p>
<h2>How Much Does a Citrix License Cost In The Long Run?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because there are always many possibilities, I needed a second calculation. This time, Citrix + Azure Virtual Desktop was the target. Cost for 50 users (their minimum) and 3 years: $60,802 for both against $67,521 Azure standalone. Then I did some TSplus maths too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">$625 for Remote Work for 25 workstations, $2,500 for <a href="https://tsplus.net/two-factor-authentication/">2FA </a>and full Advanced Security for 5 servers (arbitrarily), $1,350 for Remote Support for 3 years (arbitrarily again), and, to make sure we're not pretending, add $2000 for full enterprise Remote Access for unlimited users so you can publish apps of any generation to any PC in your business or elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That's $6,475 to which we can add the Support and Updates service just to be sure. It is calculated as only 15% of the licenses cost since it is for 3 years. A grand total of $7,446.5 for 3 years. Whichever way I take, it will be hard for us to reach Citrix subscription prices. Especially as our bundles make the above TSplus software prices lower than my estimate.</p>
<h2>Conclusion on Affordable Citrix Alternative, TSplus</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Each Citrix or alternative solution will need to be relevant to your business. Whatever you choose will have to be tailored to your business uses and needs. You nee to decide how many or few users you will provide with this or that tool, with remote access to their workstation or other.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Whatever you do, we are certain our software holds best value-for-money for SMBs. For further information, do visit our website and see for yourself how <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus </a>provides a simple, secure and efficient software suite. No matter whether you wish to secure your network, get your users working remotely or both. TSplus does it quickly and without heavy hidden set-up, infrastructure, training and staffing costs.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

You could want to know the cost of a Citrix license for any number of reasons. It may be you have a good but expensive experience but are looking for a cheaper alternative! You may have a bad time with it and want to try something new\u2026 Or maybe you are new to remote anything and discovering what it all means?<\/p><p>Anyhow, at <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">TSplus<\/a>, curiosity is welcome so we\u2019ll provide you what we know about the cost of a Citrix license. Then, along the way, we would like to present our simple, secure, efficient and very importantly highly affordable software. We have solutions for remote access, remote support and remote work as well as server and farm monitoring. Last but not least, all are built to function securely.<\/p>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>Citrix Licensing \u2013 Subscription Based<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Generally, Citrix has opted for a subscription-based licensing policy. Most of its products and services are now billed monthly or yearly, whether they incur a start-off fee or not. Subscriptions are useful to even out cost over a period of time. But, wheigh a subscription and a permanent license comparatively over the long run. It is unlikely that the subscription will turn out cheaper than the one-off sale.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For good or bad, Citrix choose to rent their service on subscription. TSplus licenses, on the other hand, are generally permanent, meaning you pay once and for all. Similarly to Citrix, we do additionally recommend an optional yearly subscription. This is to our Support and Updates service.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The service is calculated as a percentage of your licenses and is detailed in our downloadable price list. We see it as essential as it provides you the latest updates and versions of the software you have purchased. Finally, each of our products can be purchased individually and we have created bundles as well. Our bundles make combining TSplus products easier, quicker and even more affordable. You can go on reading there, if you are already curious to choose a <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/alternatives-to-citrix\/\">Citrix alternative<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Scalable Citrix Licenses Per User or Per Device<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Citrix scale their licenses per user or per device. When you want to estimate the cost of your set-up, you will rapidly be invited to contact their team. Finding out prices without necessarily contacting them is a feat. Our software and bundles, like Citrix licenses, are scalable. You can adapt your order to the size, structure and needs of your company.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We have chosen to offer thresholds for certain products and exact quantity for others. Anyhow, our web-shop calculates everything for you, according to what quantity you input. This way, Remote Access is available for 3, 5, 10, 25 or unlimited users. Within our online shop, you can immediately see the price for the provision you choose for your business. We are confident this simple remote solution is within anyone's budget.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Citrix clients have the possibility of saving money when jointly purchasing Azure Virtual Desktop and Citrix. Also, prices decrease when clients pay for more users. For this example, it was possible to work out a financial cost. Nonetheless, at many other stages, we struggled to obtain precise pricing information. Generally, around their website, we ended up finding out we needed to contact them for a quote.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Financial Cost Versus True Cost of a Citrix License<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Citrix software solutions and many others incur \u201cinvisible\u201d costs on top of their subscription bill. There are infrastructure issues and staff-related questions to consider when changing certain things within a company. Buying new software is no different. Here, main tangible concerns will be regarding hardware and network while primary non-tangibles will be staff and user-related.<\/p>\n\n<h2>First, Cost For Hardware And IT Set-Up:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Is its security promising? Can you rely on it?<\/li>\n \t<li>Can you keep current devices?<\/li>\n \t<li>Or does choosing Citrix command a company-wide upgrade of PC devices?<\/li>\n \t<li>How about the server set-up and available resources?<\/li>\n \t<li>What about the network (Local and wider)?<\/li>\n \t<li>Sufficient or could there be costly needs to meet?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Second, Cost For Users And Staff:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>What work habits going to need modifying?<\/li>\n \t<li>Or can it be implemented seamlessly?<\/li>\n \t<li>What will the learning curve involve?<\/li>\n \t<li>Who will need training to use the software?<\/li>\n \t<li>Will you need to hire or reassign staff to keep everything in hand?<\/li>\n \t<li>Does the user experience promise to be optimal?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How Much Does a Citrix License Cost Overall?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">All in all, probably more than you'd like. Of course, we know it depends on each company's set-up and needs, both in terms of devices and software capabilities. But when the different outlays are added up, it is no wonder there are numerous searches and articles for Citrix alternatives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our remote solutions, including <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/\">Remote Access<\/a>, have been developed with care keeping in sight the need for good value for money. Now, an example: prices for Citrix Secure Private Access Standard start at just over $3 per user per month. You have to subscribe for a minimum of 500 users for their site to give you a price. Never mind it being degressive from that stage if you run a Small or Medium business.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So here is what I totted up. Let's say the above Citrix solution would work out as $915 for one year for 25 users. I calculated that going on the basis that some other products can be purchased from \"as low as\" 25 users. Remote Work licenses for 25 users and the additional Support and Updates service for 3 years amounts to just less than that. $906.25 for three years could leave you able to do wonders with those $915 that you won't spend next year and $915 the following. And seeing how simple to handle our software is, no need for lengthy training, extra staffing, costly set-up or the like.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How Much Does a Citrix License Cost In The Long Run?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Because there are always many possibilities, I needed a second calculation. This time, Citrix + Azure Virtual Desktop was the target. Cost for 50 users (their minimum) and 3 years: $60,802 for both against $67,521 Azure standalone. Then I did some TSplus maths too.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">$625 for Remote Work for 25 workstations, $2,500 for <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/two-factor-authentication\/\">2FA <\/a>and full Advanced Security for 5 servers (arbitrarily), $1,350 for Remote Support for 3 years (arbitrarily again), and, to make sure we're not pretending, add $2000 for full enterprise Remote Access for unlimited users so you can publish apps of any generation to any PC in your business or elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">That's $6,475 to which we can add the Support and Updates service just to be sure. It is calculated as only 15% of the licenses cost since it is for 3 years. A grand total of $7,446.5 for 3 years. Whichever way I take, it will be hard for us to reach Citrix subscription prices. Especially as our bundles make the above TSplus software prices lower than my estimate.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion on Affordable Citrix Alternative, TSplus<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each Citrix or alternative solution will need to be relevant to your business. Whatever you choose will have to be tailored to your business uses and needs. You nee to decide how many or few users you will provide with this or that tool, with remote access to their workstation or other.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Whatever you do, we are certain our software holds best value-for-money for SMBs. For further information, do visit our website and see for yourself how <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">TSplus <\/a>provides a simple, secure and efficient software suite. No matter whether you wish to secure your network, get your users working remotely or both.

Do you need to know how to monitor Windows server 2008? Whether 2008 or any others, if you have servers, you need to monitor their performance and usage. For some quick steps followed by our sleek  and simple solution, <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a>, please read on.
<h2>Reasons to Monitoring&nbsp;Windows Server 2008</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">IT technicians like to know their servers and networks are up and running smoothly. Therefore, any network needs monitoring, whether for peace of mind or efficiency. Indeed, system overload, lagging, downtime, etc. are amongst just a few problems sure to come up without monitoring. No matter how good a team's planning and scheduling might be.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Windows Server 2008, just like any other server, may have issues that can only be pi-pointed through monitoring. This leaves with all the how to questions relating to monitor a server, this one more specifically.</p>

<h2>What to Monitor in Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Similarly to its fellow-machine, Windows 7 devices will require monitoring. And just the same goes for websites. The aspects that technicians usually monitor are usage, of network, CPU and memory. Another important variable is disk input/output. Yet, no need to worry: there is a performance viewer within the Microsoft Management consoles of Windows 7 and Windows server 2008.</p>

<h2>How to Monitor Windows Server 2008</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here, you need to gather data, since data is what can show and help identify problems as they occur. So, let's get started. You need to access administrative tools, or your task manager. Firstly, tools like performance monitor are going to come in useful. Secondly, counters. These need to be set-up manually.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Steps to follow:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>in your "Start Menu", open the "Control Panel".</li>
 	<li>There you will find "System and Security".</li>
 	<li>Next, in "Administrative Tools",</li>
 	<li>you can open "Performance Monitor".</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once inside the performance monitor window, you can refine your preferences.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You then have to validate this and make sure it runs, activating it within the performance monitor. To do this, in the "Data collector sets" scroll down to "Create data logs". You then need to check "Performance counters" and validate. As for counters, they are elements that need to be installed on any given device to be monitored. Think of them as the cookies of networking.</p>

<h2>Simple Affordable Server Monitoring Alternative for Windows Server</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Shall we stop and take stock? This is a lot of clicking and setting up. If you are new to all this, it may already have scared you off. And if an IT technician or support agent, you may be relieved to know that <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus</a> has a simple, user-friendly alternative to all this.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, installing TSplus Server Monitoring is straight forward and using it could hardly be simpler. Within a handful of clicks it s up and running! A lot of attention has gone into the design and ergonomy of the console. Additionally, the Server and Website monitoring features and possibilities initially built into it were carefully selected. Finally, like all of our software, Server Monitoring is regularly updated and improved.</p>

<h2>Great Features of TSplus Server Monitoring Alternative</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One great feature is the customisation of reports. Businesses can publish reports that fly their colours and bear company branding and logos. The data in a report can be selected or un-checked according to its target audience. Tables and graphs can show more or less precision depending on whether the reader will need detailed reporting or an overview.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And since the surveillance is constant, any issue can be dealt with just about instantly. Agents can set threshold at which to received alerts. These can be for downtime, CPU usage, and more. Then, depending on preferences, it is easy to set up notifications for email or Teams. That way, even away from the monitoring screen, relevant staff are made aware of any mishaps in the server or network.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on How to Monitor Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>In conclusion, <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">Server Monitoring</a> is a tool for your team to better prevent, detect, diagnose and solve issues and events that can occur daily with any network and server.

Therefore, any network needs monitoring, whether for peace of mind or efficiency. Indeed, system overload, lagging, downtime, etc. are amongst just a few problems sure to come up without monitoring. No matter how good a team's planning and scheduling might be.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Windows Server 2008, just like any other server, may have issues that can only be pi-pointed through monitoring. This leaves with all the how to questions relating to monitor a server, this one more specifically.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What to Monitor in Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Similarly to its fellow-machine, Windows 7 devices will require monitoring. And just the same goes for websites. The aspects that technicians usually monitor are usage, of network, CPU and memory. Another important variable is disk input\/output. Yet, no need to worry: there is a performance viewer within the Microsoft Management consoles of Windows 7 and Windows server 2008.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How to Monitor Windows Server 2008<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here, you need to gather data, since data is what can show and help identify problems as they occur. So, let's get started. You need to access administrative tools, or your task manager. Firstly, tools like performance monitor are going to come in useful. Secondly, counters. These need to be set-up manually.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Steps to follow:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>in your \"Start Menu\", open the \"Control Panel\".<\/li>\n \t<li>There you will find \"System and Security\".<\/li>\n \t<li>Next, in \"Administrative Tools\",<\/li>\n \t<li>you can open \"Performance Monitor\".<\/li>\n<\/ul> <\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once inside the performance monitor window, you can refine your preferences.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You then have to validate this and make sure it runs, activating it within the performance monitor. To do this, in the \"Data collector sets\" scroll down to \"Create data logs\". You then need to check \"Performance counters\" and validate. As for counters, they are elements that need to be installed on any given device to be monitored. Think of them as the cookies of networking.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Simple Affordable Server Monitoring Alternative for Windows Server<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Shall we stop and take stock? This is a lot of clicking and setting up. If you are new to all this, it may already have scared you off.

Additionally, the Server and Website monitoring features and possibilities initially built into it were carefully selected. Finally, like all of our software, Server Monitoring is regularly updated and improved.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Great Features of TSplus Server Monitoring Alternative<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One great feature is the customisation of reports. Businesses can publish reports that fly their colours and bear company branding and logos. The data in a report can be selected or un-checked according to its target audience. Tables and graphs can show more or less precision depending on whether the reader will need detailed reporting or an overview.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And since the surveillance is constant, any issue can be dealt with just about instantly. Agents can set threshold at which to received alerts. These can be for downtime, CPU usage, and more. Then, depending on preferences, it is easy to set up notifications for email or Teams. That way, even away from the monitoring screen, relevant staff are made aware of any mishaps in the server or network.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion on How to Monitor Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>In conclusion, <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/server-monitoring\/\">Server Monitoring<\/a> is a tool for your team to better prevent, detect, diagnose and solve issues and events that can occur daily with any network and server.

		Cyber-crime is more and more sophisticated. With Internet and its good and bad opportunities growing daily, such threats are not set to go away. To secure Windows RDP against hackers and malware, IT services most definitely need stronger protection methods. They also need security that will learn and evolve with them.<h2>Securing Microsoft Remote Desktop for Working Away</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The growing trend of globe-trotting workers, shared offices and the like has seen the variety of cyber-threats increase hand-in-hand. In the light of this, <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> has been improved to provide one of the most reliable protections available. Indeed, look to decrease your network’s vulnerable points and sleep easier with Advanced Security's powerful cybersecurity functions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cybersecurity software programs are essential security measures for any remote server. Unprotected, RDP is actually an open inroad for hackers and attacks. TSplus Advanced Security provides admins with great tools to block hackers as well as to secure your Windows workstations and your Windows web servers.</p>
<h2>Disable Access From Specific Countries:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">You most likely know where your customers and users are located. Why let uninvited parties connect from countries the other side of the globe if there is no reason to do so?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Homeland Protection lets admins promptly and conveniently limit incoming connections to the countries essential for your businesses processes. It achieves this using country-based whitelisting, cutting off connections from anywhere else.</p>
<h2>Protection From Brute Force Attacks:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our Bruteforce Protection stops aggressive forays just about immediately and quarantines infected areas. Your web server will no longer need to process thousands of failed login efforts, thus also saving resources. A combination of whitelists as well as restrictions combine to stop unauthorised login attempts.</p>
<h2>Block Known Malicious IPs:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whatever your Windows device or server, make use of our pre-blocked list of over 380 million known malicious IP addresses. With this list, TSplus Advanced Security will automatically nip hackers’ attempts in the bud. At last, the sentry needed to guard remote connections and devices. What’s more, the IP address list is searchable and editable. This makes address monitoring simple. The blocked list is regularly updated, hence our Support and Updates service.</p>
<h2>Defence Against Ransomware:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ransomware assaults are still a major hazard. Indeed, numerous companies are still ill-equipped to take care of the threat. This motivates extortion demands and data stealth. Many are prepared to pay in the hope of receiving the decryption crucial to recovering their network or data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because of a relative absence of correct defence and understanding, Ransomware remains a favourite among cyber criminals. Typical ransoms paid to cyber criminals by companies affected has nearly tripled in the last year. <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/features/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> has been improved to supply highly sophisticated anti-ransomware defence.</p>
<h2>Extra Tips to Stop Hackers in Their Tracks</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Phishing emails are another top threat. Experts therefore suggest that employees be trained to identify risks. Improving cybersecurity habits is key to maintaining company information secure. And with brute-force vying to stay top of the cyber-crime league-table, we have three more swords for the fight.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is always worth reminding all staff, customers, users and anyone else that solid passwords are paramount. To that we will add multi-factor verification: we provide Two-Factor Authentication as a separate product. That way you can benefit from it even if you have not yet adopted our other products. Finally, do keep up with regular safety and security fixes (Microsoft or other) to protect your network against assailants who would exploit any recognized vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>Firewall to Increase Protection for RDP</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">All these attributes and also even more are included in TSplus Advanced Security. It is a standalone product, offering powerful protection features. It ensures web servers, information and customers remain secure whether using TSplus or any other software.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We recently added its very own built-in firewall! To enable it, open the "Advanced settings" tab of the AdminTool then change "Use Windows Firewall" to "No" in “Product settings”. This will automatically turn on the Advanced Security firewall.</p>
<h2>To Conclude on Stopping Cyber-attacks on RDP</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">First and foremost, Advanced Security is affordable. Its other characteristics: innovative, effective and straightforward, all add to this protection tool for RDP based networks. Treat yourself to solid cyber-protection by picking the best toolkit: Advanced Security. Purchase 360-degree defence for Windows servers and remote sessions <a href="https://tsplus.net/pricing/advanced-security/">here</a> in a few clicks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Whether you wish to remote into a server for application management, updating, fixing or any other purpose, chances are you’ll be using one generalised way. Indeed, the question of how to RDP into a server is often asked because of RDP. The protocol has been available by default on most Windows devices for over 20 years by now.
<h2>Pre-requisites and Necessary Information</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before we start, there is one prerequisite to establishing an RDP connection into any server or device. That is simply to make sure it has remote connections allowed. You can check this in settings and enable remote connections if need be.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also, bear in mind it can be unsafe to remote into devices that lack valid SSL certification. If that is the case, be sure you know the server is not compromised and you trust it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first thing you need is the IP address of the server you want to remotely reach. The second are your login credentials: username and password.</p>

<h2>Steps to RDP Into a Server</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>To connect from a Windows device, open the “Settings” in your “Start” menu and find “Remote Desktop and RemoteApp Connections”. This will give you access to the connection client.</li>
 	<li>(You can also search for it if you prefer.)</li>
 	<li>In the Remote Desktop Connection window, you can then enter the hostname or the IP address for the server you want to access. Validate by clicking “Connect”.</li>
 	<li>Next, you will be prompted to enter your login details in the login window. That done, you can click OK.</li>
 	<li>At this point, your remote server should display on your local screen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to RDP Into a Server From Other Devices</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the right application you can remote into a server from other devices such as Android or iOS smartphones and tablets. The steps to RDP into the server are similar allowing for the different OS and presentation.</p>

<h2>Simple Affordable Alternatives Using RDP</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A lot of our own software makes use of RDP to access servers and PCs. Also, via HTML5, so without any such protocol, we provide distant access from almost any device. But Remote Access and application publishing is not our only centre of attention. TSplus developers have built security, monitoring and screen sharing software to bring to our clients simple affordable tools to fit budgets from SMBs to corporate. The focus of much of our recent work has been screen sharing and control.</p>

<h2>To Conclude on How to RDP Into a Server</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With TSplus Remote Access, remoting into a server using RDP is set to be the simple and efficient and to cost less than ever. From the straight forwards set-up to the self-explanatory navigation and possibilities, click here and let Remote Access surprise you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<img width="1120" height="630" src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/How-Does-TeamViewer-Work.png" alt="Article title &quot;How Does TeamViewer Work?&quot;, TSplus logo and link, with background picture of two people working at computers and wearing headsets." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/How-Does-TeamViewer-Work.png 1120w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/How-Does-TeamViewer-Work-300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/How-Does-TeamViewer-Work-1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/How-Does-TeamViewer-Work-768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/How-Does-TeamViewer-Work-18x10.png 18w" sizes="(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px" />								</a>
Having evolved since its release in 2005, how does TeamViewer work and offer its wide possibilities like remote access and screen control? It allows distant maintenance of computers and other devices by agents from multiple locations and a variety of devices. Other software developers contend on the market using the same and different technology. Here are some basic notions of what’s behind TeamViewer and its alternatives. Then we can touch on our Remote Support, which we proudly place amongst <a href="https://tsplus.net/top-alternatives-to-teamviewer-for-remote-support/">best TeamViewer alternatives</a>, especially for simplicity and affordability.
<h2>What Can TeamViewer Do When Connecting You Remotely?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With TeamViewer, users are able to establish a secure link between devices. This application grants access to more than just remote viewing or control of a device. Additionally, ou have the option to use the camera or microphone of your device while linked to another computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The connection can be made between various types of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones. It also enables you to share files and screens, conduct online meetings, support different operating systems, chat, or make video calls.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Where screen sharing and support is concerned, TSplus products include <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">Remote Support</a>. A simple, efficient and affordable tool enables updating, fixing and more from any place with an Internet connection.</p>

<h2>How Does TeamViewer Work?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Each device or user has a separate password and both end devices (endpoints) must provide their credentials to set up a remote control connection.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To run TeamViewer, you will be assigned an ID on their broker server. The app client creates a secure tunnel between both endpoints. In order to establish the connection you enter this ID and TeamViewer will pass it through the tunnel to the destination. That is where you will be prompted for your password. Once the password is entered, the connection is finalised and secure communication can take place.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By default, TeamViewer utilizes port 80 to connect to a central server. In the event of a connection being established, the unique ID that is granted will enable the server to recognize you as online.</p>

<h2>How Do Alternatives to TeamViewer Work?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Basically, RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), VPN (Virtual Private Network) and VNC (Virtual Network Computing) are the main options affording complete access and full control.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Amongst the other possibilities, one worth noting is the use of a proxy server. As it is different while still providing full access anyhow, it stands out from the rest. Finally, other potential ways of accessing devices from a distance have contexts, limitations or differences that prevent them from having their place here.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That said, RDP is the protocol used by TSplus software. Exchanges transit via TSplus servers dotted around the world. Support takes places over HTML5 and is secured using credentials, SSL encryption plus, should you choose it, <a href="https://tsplus.net/two-factor-authentication/">2FA</a> as well.</p>

<h2>Remote Access and Other Capabilities</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TeamViewer provides remote access to server, PC and mobile devices. Such distant access means a user can control a remote device anywhere from any other location around the globe. Therefore, typical uses include support and updating or fixing operating systems. All of this being done from afar, work can thus be done instantly and without counting commuting distance or time.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Users can transfer files between the two distant devices. These can be captures, photos, documents, video… Either endpoint can prompt the download or upload.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Various tools, ideal for collaboration, mean users can work as a team on projects or interventions. Favourites enable users to view and share screens, view documents and therefore exchange as they might in the same room.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Security is paramount with the Internet, especially where access and data are concerned. TeamViewer and any similar software are not exempt of the dangers and it is important for all professional and private users to keep this in mind. TeamViewer have implemented the use of login credentials (ID and password), data encryption (tunnel) and even two-factor authentication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remote Maintenance with TeamViewer or Alternatives</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see, TeamViewer is a tool you could use to maintain and upgrade your network or other devices from a distance. You may also choose an alternative, potentially based on pricing reasons for instance. Indeed, TeamViewer is a renowned brand and its cost can be higher than an average small business would need.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nonetheless, TSplus, amongst other options, is an affordable contender with straightforward handling and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/software/product/TSplus-Remote-Support/">great customer feedback</a>.</p>

<h2>How Does TSplus Do the Job? Our Solution for Remote Control and Screen Sharing</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, TSplus has recently redesigned its remote control and screen sharing software, Remote Support. Our team of developers has also added features to it in the process. The result is a simpler than ever tool for controlling screens remotely and providing support to any Windows device anywhere on the Globe. With no installation, it is rapidly up and running. As well as clearer navigation, the ergonomics and aesthetics have been brought up to date.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since the latest update of Remote Support, users can now create folders to organize their computers. These are just some of a series of improvements the product has undergone over the past few months. Moreover, many of these have been the result of customer and user feedback to our various teams.</p>

<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Terminal-Server-Monitoring-Software.png" alt="Article title &quot;Terminal Server Monitoring Software&quot;, TSplus logo and link, with background image of a hand drawing a graph." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Terminal-Server-Monitoring-Software.png 1120w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Terminal-Server-Monitoring-Software-300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Terminal-Server-Monitoring-Software-1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Terminal-Server-Monitoring-Software-768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Terminal-Server-Monitoring-Software-18x10.png 18w" sizes="(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px" width="1120" height="630">								</a>
Until Windows 2008, what is now RDS was known as Terminal Services. Terminal servers of any kind most often function using such technology to provide networking and to communicate. Incidentally, for a network to run efficiently, any servers need to be used without overload or glitches. Terminal server monitoring software is the best way of watching out for this and surveying areas of potential concern.
<h2>Wide Variety of Terminal Server Monitoring Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are many tools and products available to watch servers and networks. Whether free or paid and whether issue-specific or with a wider array of parameters in focus, the choice is broad. Indeed, some developers have chosen to monitor one specific aspect of a server or network, a set of actions within a set remit. Others have opted for a tool-kit approach, choosing a number of different items and watching each of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Generally, it seems that IT administrators often choose to mix-and-match, combining any number of more or less comprehensive tools. This enables them to tailor their tool-set to their needs.</p>

<h2>Monitoring Your Terminal Servers with TSplus Server Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a>, you have a tool-kit of carefully picked essentials. Our software gives you access to both historical and current information and statistics about your servers, applications, websites, and users. It allows you to see both a thorough and a specific picture of your network, its performance and its usage. Thus, you can quickly remediate problems and easily generate and share relevant reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You have full control of your environment. And, with its centralized interface, you can monitor all of your servers and websites from one place, for a full understanding. Consequently, you can even anticipate, avoid and prevent potential problems before they impact your operations.</p>

<h2>Easy Deployment and Configuration</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Firstly, TSplus Server Monitoring takes just a few minutes of set up and initial configuration. Choose the Windows server on which you wish to install it and follow the steps set out in our Quick Start guide. Once in place, administrators can easily add or remove monitored servers and websites.</p>

<h2>Real-Time Monitoring of Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Secondly: get real-time reports and alerts for any performance issues in your infrastructure. The console is user-friendly and you can navigate it easily. Therefore, all your servers, websites, applications, and remote-users can be monitored from there in all simplicity.</p>

<h2>Reduction in IT Costs</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thirdly, TSplus Server Monitoring comes under permanent licenses, providing you with a cost-effective alternative. This will allow you to optimize your IT expenses. Amongst other benefits, you can identify and cut down on any over-licensed applications.</p>

<h2>Maximize Productivity</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fourthly, you can boost productivity with its smart and easy-to-read reports. You can rapidly identify opportunities for improvement. One example could be migrating users from over-utilized servers to under-utilized ones. This can increase the performance of your servers and the productivity of your users.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The comprehensive console is equipped with a range of features for server management, website monitoring, alert management, administration, and customization.</p>

<h2>Focus on a Key Feature</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, let us home in on just one specific feature. A highly useful one, though we do say so. <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/features/#alerts-management">Alerts.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can set-up alerts for key server metrics: processor, memory, disk read/write usage, disk used space, active users and downtime duration. Additionally, you may set alerts for website uptime and downtime duration. All of these can be customised and sent as notification to appropriate people.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on Software for Monitoring Terminal Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>To conclude, <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">Server Monitoring</a> is a tool-set designed to provide you with a simple single monitoring software that does the basics well. It enables IT teams to monitor both Websites and servers closely. Each particular value has been chosen carefully in order for you to spot and prevent the greatest number of networking issues. All of this without exploding your IT and training budgets.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

Remote desktop has become a common expression even in households where IT is not central. With the increase in distant working, people remotely accessing the office has rocketed. <strong>Technical support has no longer got the monopoly on logging into our office workstation or company server. With the right software, user credentials and an internet connection, any of us can work from anywhere. You have come to the right place to read up on how to use remote desktop. <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-work/">TSplus Remote Work</a> is a great simple tool in that field.</strong>
<h2>What is Remote Desktop?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote Desktop is software which enables distant access to a computer device. It exists by extension of remote control software. That is the kind of program used to remotely fix and update a server or PC from afar by controlling another device’s screens, mouse and keyboard. Indeed, with support software such as Remote Support, agents are able to take control of a distant computer, on invitation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the right credentials, they receive the authorisation to see the screen and control the keyboard and mouse or the device on which they need to work. Similarly, Remote Work and other distant working programs make it possible for workers to use their office workstation from anywhere. The software runs their device from a distance and displays everything on the screen of the local one.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to its use of RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) TSplus Remote Work puts at your disposal the content of a distant workstation. Over a secured Internet connection, users can work from any computer, smartphone or other, as though sat in front of their office computer. This means it is a tool to make any office worker mobile. And also, that home-work and business trips can take place seamlessly.</p>

<h2>How to Set Up Remote Desktop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">From a user’s point of view, unseen actions will include the network administrator downloading and installing their chosen software. Where TSplus Remote Work is concerned, this is straightforward. Our developers have worked to build efficient software, starting with its set-up and implementation. To add, edit and remove users or workstations is rapid. What’s more, in the Connection Broker, workstations can be assigned to multiple users, such as staff who may work opposite shifts. All administrative actions are centralised in the Admin Console. Once the above is done, it is possible to begin directly, or manage specifics per user.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As I said, to the user, all that is invisible. One aspect can be managed either by administrators or staff depending on company preferences. This is the fact remote access needs the target PC to be on. Important actions are: ensure the workstation is powered on; deactivate Standby or Hibernation modes; turn off monitors.</p>

<h2>How to Use Remote Desktop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">All in all, users need to tick three boxes: Internet access wherever their home-working or roaming office is scheduled to be; Web-enabled device with their favourite browser; credentials.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you want the precise how-to guide, here it goes.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Step one, open your device and browser.</li>
 	<li>Step two, go to the Web Portal.</li>
 	<li>Step three, log in using your credentials.</li>
 	<li>Step four, carry on wherever you left off when you closed your session at work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Security For Remote Desktop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whether you choose TSplus Remote Work or another Remote Desktop management software, it is recommended to add 2FA to strengthen security. I’m glad to say that users more often set strong passwords nowadays than ever. No surprise, with the rise of cyber-crime over the past decade or so. Many websites and companies set minimum requirements for passwords much higher than they used to. But there is still more we can do to rest easier.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also, depending on your choice as a company, Advanced Security can be added to the array of company software tools. Indeed, why pass up on all-round cyber-security when such a simple, affordable and complete solution is at hand.</p>

<h2>Admin Possibilities for Remote Work</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Customise the Web Portal and <a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/remote-work/html5-client">HTML5 Client</a> to reflect company branding. Thus, staff will feel the continuity of their corporate experience as well be swiftly back into their last work item. Everything from logos, text and images to the actual domain name can be tailored to match, for example, the company website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other aspects that can be adapted to specific needs of a business are the menu bar and the likes of sound preferences, file transfer, timeout… These items will guide the user experience, just as such parameters as permissions. Permissions reflect the varying access different users are granted to parts of the network, including apps and files, to specific actions, including removing or disabling software or printers, and finally to the system.</p>

<h2>How to Use TSplus Remote Work</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Amongst its features, TSplus Remote Work includes its Web Portal. Thanks to the self-hosted Web Portal, whether on premises or in the Cloud, users can securely log into their workstations. Additionally, this enables a user to start back where they left off, resuming their work exactly where they stopped, even without saving. Finally, there is Remote Printing. Printing remains a fundamental matter in just about any office. Thankfully, with Universal Printer, it is possible to print securely to local or remote printers or to PDF.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on How to Use Remote Desktop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Granted, there are numerous solutions for remotely using office workstations. <strong>At TSplus, we developed Remote Work as a short rapid solution to get staff mobile and home-work enabled. It has been designed with affordability, efficiency and security in mind.

With the increase in distant working, people remotely accessing the office has rocketed. <strong>Technical support has no longer got the monopoly on logging into our office workstation or company server. With the right software, user credentials and an internet connection, any of us can work from anywhere. You have come to the right place to read up on how to use remote desktop. <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-work\/\">TSplus Remote Work<\/a> is a great simple tool in that field.<\/strong><\/p>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>What is Remote Desktop?<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Remote Desktop is software which enables distant access to a computer device. It exists by extension of remote control software. That is the kind of program used to remotely fix and update a server or PC from afar by controlling another device\u2019s screens, mouse and keyboard. Indeed, with support software such as Remote Support, agents are able to take control of a distant computer, on invitation.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With the right credentials, they receive the authorisation to see the screen and control the keyboard and mouse or the device on which they need to work. Similarly, Remote Work and other distant working programs make it possible for workers to use their office workstation from anywhere. The software runs their device from a distance and displays everything on the screen of the local one.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Thanks to its use of RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) TSplus Remote Work puts at your disposal the content of a distant workstation. Over a secured Internet connection, users can work from any computer, smartphone or other, as though sat in front of their office computer. This means it is a tool to make any office worker mobile. And also, that home-work and business trips can take place seamlessly.<\/p><h2>How to Set Up Remote Desktop<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">From a user\u2019s point of view, unseen actions will include the network administrator downloading and installing their chosen software. Where TSplus Remote Work is concerned, this is straightforward. Our developers have worked to build efficient software, starting with its set-up and implementation. To add, edit and remove users or workstations is rapid. What\u2019s more, in the Connection Broker, workstations can be assigned to multiple users, such as staff who may work opposite shifts. All administrative actions are centralised in the Admin Console. Once the above is done, it is possible to begin directly, or manage specifics per user.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As I said, to the user, all that is invisible. One aspect can be managed either by administrators or staff depending on company preferences. This is the fact remote access needs the target PC to be on. Important actions are: ensure the workstation is powered on; deactivate Standby or Hibernation modes; turn off monitors.<\/p><h2>How to Use Remote Desktop<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">All in all, users need to tick three boxes: Internet access wherever their home-working or roaming office is scheduled to be; Web-enabled device with their favourite browser; credentials.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you want the precise how-to guide, here it goes.<\/p><ul><li>Step one, open your device and browser.<\/li><li>Step two, go to the Web Portal.<\/li><li>Step three, log in using your credentials.<\/li><li>Step four, carry on wherever you left off when you closed your session at work.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Additional Security For Remote Desktop<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whether you choose TSplus Remote Work or another Remote Desktop management software, it is recommended to add 2FA to strengthen security. I\u2019m glad to say that users more often set strong passwords nowadays than ever. No surprise, with the rise of cyber-crime over the past decade or so. Many websites and companies set minimum requirements for passwords much higher than they used to. But there is still more we can do to rest easier.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Also, depending on your choice as a company, Advanced Security can be added to the array of company software tools. Indeed, why pass up on all-round cyber-security when such a simple, affordable and complete solution is at hand.<\/p><h2>Admin Possibilities for Remote Work<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Customise the Web Portal and <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.terminalserviceplus.com\/remote-work\/html5-client\">HTML5 Client<\/a> to reflect company branding. Thus, staff will feel the continuity of their corporate experience as well be swiftly back into their last work item. Everything from logos, text and images to the actual domain name can be tailored to match, for example, the company website.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Other aspects that can be adapted to specific needs of a business are the menu bar and the likes of sound preferences, file transfer, timeout\u2026 These items will guide the user experience, just as such parameters as permissions. Permissions reflect the varying access different users are granted to parts of the network, including apps and files, to specific actions, including removing or disabling software or printers, and finally to the system.<\/p><h2>How to Use TSplus Remote Work<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Amongst its features, TSplus Remote Work includes its Web Portal. Thanks to the self-hosted Web Portal, whether on premises or in the Cloud, users can securely log into their workstations. Additionally, this enables a user to start back where they left off, resuming their work exactly where they stopped, even without saving. Finally, there is Remote Printing. Printing remains a fundamental matter in just about any office. Thankfully, with Universal Printer, it is possible to print securely to local or remote printers or to PDF.<\/p><h2>Conclusion on How to Use Remote Desktop<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Granted, there are numerous solutions for remotely using office workstations. <strong>At TSplus, we developed Remote Work as a short rapid solution to get staff mobile and home-work enabled. It has been designed with affordability, efficiency and security in mind.

When companies have legacy applications, there always comes a time for choosing. Choosing to replace them with something more modern, at what cost? Choosing to keep them in some shape or form: why and how? <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> is a tool for maximising legacy business applications.
<h2>Assets Companies Can Forget: Legacy Business Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since the generalisation of IT, companies have invested in a combination of software applications and hardware. This has enabled some to soar economically, technologically or as a brand. Thus, fast innovations in IT have changed the face of business. In addition, expectations, as well as service requirements, have evolved. IT infrastructure can be extremely contrasted from one company to the next.</p>

<h2>For Maximising, Legacy Business Applications Meet the Web</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some businesses have standard or tailor-made legacy software application. Meanwhile, others have opted for open-build applications utilizing the Web and its possibilities. Therefore, despite others considering them obsolete and re-investing, some companies are still greatly reliant on legacy software programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consider an ancient castle, built from solid material, with great craftsmanship and design. It may raise no interest in some, while to others it could be essential, ideal. In certain contexts, throwing away to begin from scratch make no sense. So, to meet the needs of tomorrow's businesses, why not <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#shared-remote-desktop">re-deploy legacy builds</a> while reworking how things are administrated? This is a key for rapid and affordable maximisation of current IT assets.</p>

<h2>What is a Legacy Application?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Legacy applications are the fruit of a use of manpower and IT potential that made financial sense at the time. Indeed, budgets and teams looked very different one, two or three decades ago. Companies could have in-house developers creating and adapting tools and ideas to their structure and requirements. Over time, some companies have entirely moved away from this, choosing main-stream generic software. Some might say they have moved with their times, as legacy could basically be nick-named ageing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the other hand, a legacy set-up will be made up of applications operating on mainframes or mid-range systems. These then access and process extensive data managed by internal (also potentially legacy) database, logistics, machinery or other software. It is likely such made-to-measure software has no available equivalent to replace it. There is no way for certain companies to feasibly move away from their old applications. Yet, the question of compatibility and upkeep remains.</p>

<h2>A Status Quo of Legacy Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As it stands, legacy applications frequently carry the following set of obstacles: use, maintenance, compatibility.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>They were usually built for in-house use, specific purposes, a company need that is niche rather than wide-spread.</li>
 	<li>Legacy software needs complementary functions that can only be added by technical teams. As mobility and time take their toll, new staff may lack the information, skill or time needed to carry on their predecessors’ work. This can unfortunately lead to unpredictability, crashes, part of the system breaking down, etc.</li>
 	<li>Their specificity is often counterbalanced by the company’s need to be part of a global market. Businesses have to use the Internet for administrative and financial tasks, to enable remote-work and more.</li>
 	<li>Legacy applications are known and used by company teams and potentially also customers. The cost of replacing them would involve much more than the cost of the appropriate new software. There are time and training costs, both where transferring and setting up is concerned and where use and adaptation come into play.</li>
 	<li>New software can cause issues where old tried-and-tested applications have been tamed by IT teams, staff and other users. Consequently, questions of trust and habit are important too, beyond the added or absent features it brings.</li>
</ul>
<h2>For Seamless Use of Legacy Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Considering what great value can be drawn from a legacy application, TSplus are glad to present how to publish software to the Web. TSplus Remote Access is a very simple and rapid way to Web-enable your applications. How better to give legacy software a new life than to make it available alongside recent applications?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to our application publication program, your staff and customers could regain tools and benefits you were about to consider lost. Migrating or replacing your software, extending it in any way, would not work out as straight-forward as downloading our program and running it. You will be able to cut down on cost and time compared to other solutions. All the while, your data and applications will not leave the safety of your company firewall. What’s more, TSplus harnesses a combination of RDP, <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#security">Web encryption</a> and HTML5 amongst other technology. The result is secure, efficient and affordable Web-enabling of your applications. Maximising your legacy business applications has never been simpler.</p>

<h2>Remotely Access Legacy and Current Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since any type of software becomes accessible to whomever you decide and even at times you chose, Remote Access will create coherence between your legacy and recent applications. Therefore, neither your customers nor you company staff need struggle. No, to needlessly learning a new system, a different application, another set of tools and features. No, to wasting any precious time and energy. Yes, to long-term investment made perennial. Yes, to staying in control of what you want to change and what you want to keep. And, yes, to trying it for free, no strings attached, for 15 days.

It is likely such made-to-measure software has no available equivalent to replace it. There is no way for certain companies to feasibly move away from their old applications. Yet, the question of compatibility and upkeep remains.<\/p>\n\n<h2>A Status Quo of Legacy Software<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As it stands, legacy applications frequently carry the following set of obstacles: use, maintenance, compatibility.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>They were usually built for in-house use, specific purposes, a company need that is niche rather than wide-spread.<\/li>\n \t<li>Legacy software needs complementary functions that can only be added by technical teams. As mobility and time take their toll, new staff may lack the information, skill or time needed to carry on their predecessors\u2019 work. This can unfortunately lead to unpredictability, crashes, part of the system breaking down, etc.<\/li>\n \t<li>Their specificity is often counterbalanced by the company\u2019s need to be part of a global market. Businesses have to use the Internet for administrative and financial tasks, to enable remote-work and more.<\/li>\n \t<li>Legacy applications are known and used by company teams and potentially also customers. The cost of replacing them would involve much more than the cost of the appropriate new software. There are time and training costs, both where transferring and setting up is concerned and where use and adaptation come into play.<\/li>\n \t<li>New software can cause issues where old tried-and-tested applications have been tamed by IT teams, staff and other users. Consequently, questions of trust and habit are important too, beyond the added or absent features it brings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>For Seamless Use of Legacy Software<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Considering what great value can be drawn from a legacy application, TSplus are glad to present how to publish software to the Web. TSplus Remote Access is a very simple and rapid way to Web-enable your applications. How better to give legacy software a new life than to make it available alongside recent applications?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Thanks to our application publication program, your staff and customers could regain tools and benefits you were about to consider lost. Migrating or replacing your software, extending it in any way, would not work out as straight-forward as downloading our program and running it. You will be able to cut down on cost and time compared to other solutions. All the while, your data and applications will not leave the safety of your company firewall. What\u2019s more, TSplus harnesses a combination of RDP, <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/features\/#security\">Web encryption<\/a> and HTML5 amongst other technology. The result is secure, efficient and affordable Web-enabling of your applications. Maximising your legacy business applications has never been simpler.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Remotely Access Legacy and Current Applications<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since any type of software becomes accessible to whomever you decide and even at times you chose, Remote Access will create coherence between your legacy and recent applications. Therefore, neither your customers nor you company staff need struggle. No, to needlessly learning a new system, a different application, another set of tools and features. No, to wasting any precious time and energy. Yes, to long-term investment made perennial. Yes, to staying in control of what you want to change and what you want to keep. And, yes, to trying it for free, no strings attached, for 15 days. For a <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-access\/features\/\">full list of features<\/a> and possibilities, do visit our website.<\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

It is no secret that RDP is an inroad for hacking if it is open to the Internet. Threats generally aim to steal data, identity, credentials and so on, often as a way to steal or blackmail money and sometimes sensitive information. Luckily, there are tools to keep RDP protected. Available solutions range from using software or credentials to virtually secure it, to physically setting it one step removed from the Web. Here are some ways to securely use RDP connection over the Internet.
<h2>Why Secure RDP Connection over the Internet</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why should everyone feel that IT and Internet security is their concern? Sadly, RDP turned out to be a loophole in the Windows operating system security. Soon after its inception, it became common knowledge that malevolent software could use RDP to use and spy on any server’s connections. Therefore, this poses a threat to most servers. It leaves them prey to hackers, network scanners, brute force robots and the like.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unless you have secured your server and connections, that is. Hence why protection is so important. Of course, knowing what to watch out for and watching at the time is also helpful. It is even better if a program will do that for you. Otherwise, “infection” can take place nearly invisibly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To efficiently counter cyber-threats, you need an anti-spyware program. Windows, of course, has its own safeguard, "Windows Defender," which uses both preventative and corrective measures to protect you. Simple, yet, there is better still. Simple and powerful are two of the characteristics TSplus aims to build into its software, especially when it comes to security.</p>

<h2>Some Specific Weaknesses in RDP Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Clicking on a malicious link in an email or on a website can allow undesirable programs to attempt to install and execute. Furthermore, this risk is particularly high when you open an RDS session. Robots scan open ports and attempt to steal your identity to log in. External IPs are known to automatically test hundreds to thousands of combinations. They do that by trying hundreds of combinations on your server every minute. These consist of typical, default and current logins and passwords and may also include other data they stole previously.</p>

<h2>ID Verification for a Secure RDP Connection Over the Internet</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">User credentials are a great way to ensure safer Internet communication, especially when you need to safeguard data and information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus has the solution: <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/features/">Advanced Security</a> is more than just anti-spyware. Installed on your system, our software will automatically watch every time you open an RDS connection and will block any attack. It actually provides analysis (based on your habits of use) as well as detects and quarantines any malware on your computer. Additionally, it allows you to remove them.</p>

<h2>How Does TSplus Advanced Security Protect RDP?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Advanced Security monitors, in real-time, any failed login attempts. It then blacklists the offending IP addresses automatically according to the threshold amount of failed attempts you set, the countries you choose to allow, the working-hours you allocate for your users... It is both a quick and easy tool to install and get up and running, and a thorough defence kit, adaptable to your specific requirements.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on No-complication Extra for a Secure RDP Connection over the Internet</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see, without changing your network parameters, it is possible to secure your RDP connections simply and rapidly, thanks to TSplus. In another article, we can look again at building specific protections into your system. For now, TSplus Advanced Security is a no-fuss go-to for complete cyber-defence. With its permanent licenses and simple handling and with over 300 million blocked known malicious IP addresses, your budget, IT admin and network are safe. <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">Try it out today.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Remote-Server-Monitoring-Service.png" alt="Article title &quot;Remote Server Monitoring Service&quot;, TSplus logo and link, with background image of city skyline at night and computer monitors showing numbers." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Remote-Server-Monitoring-Service.png 1120w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Remote-Server-Monitoring-Service-300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Remote-Server-Monitoring-Service-1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Remote-Server-Monitoring-Service-768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Remote-Server-Monitoring-Service-18x10.png 18w" sizes="(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px" width="1120" height="630">								</a>

If you run any number of servers, no doubt you would like to prevent any of the following: lagging applications, unexpected downtime, memory leaks, dependencies, server crashes, etc. Such issues are a network manager’s regular concern and much time and attention will go into resolving any of them daily. Yet, are you willing for this service to be delegated outside your company? What of your data being monitored by a third party? Not all lines of work and sectors have this option. <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> is a self-hosted yet mightily simple solution.
<h2>Core Items to Monitor in Remote Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">How do you know how much memory is utilised at any given point in time on your network of servers and websites? What do you use to see how your storage or user presence evolves throughout a day or a week? Can you monitor CPU-use and identify peak and off peak trends? Monitoring software is perhaps less prolific than certain other products but there is still a wide panel of options. Moreover, it is certainly no less important.</p>

<h2>Remote Server Monitoring Software Built With Users in Mind</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Short of tailoring some of the DIY tools available, which means having the skill and time to do so, you may happily opt for software that is ready to use. It is likely to imply choosing to do without particular aspects you did not want to leave off your shopping list. TSplus software is designed and improved with thought and care. This is visible in the fact that over time, our products evolve influenced by customer and user feedback. Therefore we are confident to have struck a good balance of essentials.</p>

<h2>Simplicity, Affordability and Security for Remote Server Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/features/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> is a greatly simple tool with basic features meant for server and website monitoring without fuss. Budgets being tight and security issues rife, these two concerns watermark this piece of software more than ever. Indeed, it is affordable and very easy to implement, needing no training to set-up.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, Server Monitoring is self-hosted. The monitoring console goes on the server of your choice. Then, you install a small agent on each of your servers to be monitored. All your metrics remain yours and yours alone, with the historical data saved where you chose. A perk that leaves you free to host on-premises or in the cloud according to your requirements and possibilities.</p>

<h2>Stand-Alone or Integrated Remote Server Monitoring Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Should you already have such tools as remote work software or support and screen sharing software, why not consider adding our monitoring features to your toolkit. Though they are built to interact seamlessly with each other, each TSplus product is also available as separate product. One of our aims it to give as many businesses as possible the ability to benefit from such software as Server Monitoring, without breaking the bank or wasting time. now more than ever, this seems important for SMBs or corporations alike.</p>

<h2>All Monitored Servers and Websites Remotely Visible on a Simple Home Tab</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Every server you add will be visible on the Home tab and you can see further detail in other tabs according to where you navigate. Infrastructure grows with a business. From the space needed to the devices, tools (whether software or hardware), and from staffing to organisation, there is a lot to consider. Thankfully, TSplus Server Monitoring is easily scalable as long as the server from which you are monitoring has sufficient RAM.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also, bear in mind that gradually, the historical data will amount to a lot. If only since monitoring is in real-time and all the more if you have many servers and websites to monitor. So you may also want to have specific space allocated to the SQL database. Our support team are on hand for such questions and can guide you along the way.</p>

<h2>Key Feature: Straight-forward Management of Monitored Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To add and delete servers is as simple as clicking + to add and x to remove. Related to this and to give you an idea of what our Store has to offer, <a href="https://tsplus.net/pricing/server-monitoring/">Essentials Edition will monitor 1 server</a>, Startup: 5 servers, and Business: 10. Above 10 servers, you will need to be in touch with our Support team for them to carry out the necessary customisation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you see, it is easy to grow and change your network as your business evolves. Nevertheless, it remains highly important to remember that deleting a server will in parallel delete any related data. Therefore, should you need to retain the historical data related to the server you are about to remove, do make sure you save a copy of it elsewhere. You can choose to either save it in the shape of reports or as it stands in your database, or why not both.</p>

<h2>Adding and Modifying Monitored Servers in a Click</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Adding a server involves entering the server URL and port number. In the edit window, you can also change the server “Alias” to differentiate machines. Finally, you can enter a host name and IP address, for remote control. This window opens when you click on the pen-on-paper icon of a server (or website). The Server Monitoring Quick-start guide and documentation are full of information if you need to know more about <a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/server-monitoring/servers-management">Server Management in the TSplus console</a> or for any other technical aspect.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on Remote Server Monitoring Service or Self-Hosted Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">For server performance tracking, TSplus Server Monitoring provides no frills, but an efficient and simple toolset. It enables you to ensure applications have enough memory to run and their users can connect without experiencing delays. Developed to do the job, it works easily and without fuss. It keeps you and your colleagues informed. Do you want to host Server Monitoring for your own network? Or maybe you are considering becoming an MSP? Either way, our products can be purchase individually or you can build a complete suite for your company or in order to provide services to other businesses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>By trying it for 15 days for free, come and check why we believe ours is the best value-for-money remote server monitoring software. You will see we don’t even ask you for your credit card to download the <a href="https://tsplus.net/download/">fully featured trial version</a>. Indeed, we expect you to find it so ergonomic and useful as to buy it.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Windows-10-RDP-Client-Alternative.png" alt="Article title &quot;Windows 10 RDP Client Alternative&quot;, TSplus logo and link, illustrated by a picture of white high lobby ceiling with many skylights." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Windows-10-RDP-Client-Alternative.png 1120w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Windows-10-RDP-Client-Alternative-300x169.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Windows-10-RDP-Client-Alternative-1024x576.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Windows-10-RDP-Client-Alternative-768x432.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Windows-10-RDP-Client-Alternative-18x10.png 18w" sizes="(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px" width="1120" height="630">								</a>

For some years now, Microsoft has been including its (proprietary yet universal…) Remote Desktop Protocol on Pro Versions of Windows PCs. If you are reading this, it is likely you are looking for an RDP Client alternative for Windows 10, but why not for Windows 7 or Windows 11. As for any software, there are alternatives of so many kinds. So, it is essential to be clear about one’s needs before setting out. A search is then mainly a matter of comparing contenders before finally testing our favourites. Looking for a Windows 10 RDP Client Alternative is no different. Since any browser search will do the job of finding all the competitors for you, here is directly my top choice. Unsurprisingly, I would like to tell you about <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a>.
<h2>Activating Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on the Host PC</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like I mentioned, RDP is to be found on Pro versions of Windows. It makes these servers potentially accessible over the Internet. All that needs doing is to open the Remote Desktop preferences and activate the protocol which is deactivated by default. It is easily located using the search bar if you have not directly spotted it amongst the network headings.</p>

<h2>Internet and Network settings for Windows 10 RDP Client</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">That done, please do remember to ensure you have organised the appropriate Web security measures. Unsurprisingly if you keep up to date on Internet related news, one of the recuring headlines is cyber-security and hacking. So, there is a great reason to make a detour via our <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">Advanced Security</a> pages to see what we can do for your network and peace of mind.</p>

<h2>Setting Up a Windows 10 RDP Client Alternative</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Generally, client and host software parts need installing, regardless of the product. There seems to be an over-the-board demand for both parts, and developing companies follow this. The host can be a server, or a PC with RDP (which, as I said, means most Windows pro devices and does not include Home versions) with or without screen, keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As for <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus</a> Remote Access, or TSplus Remote Support or Remote Work for that matter, things are no different. You will find our Quick-Start guide talks of Server and Client, which amounts to host and client.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once set up, the host computer will then be accessible to the client machine. The server (host) could share their screen, OS, files etc. as per remote control software. Here, the overall focus is application publication and remote desktop use, for distant work and company-wide IT consistence.</p>

<h2>Windows PCs Accessible From Any Device Anywhere</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Server-side, right now, Remote Access is supported on Windows PC alone. But watch this space... And, thanks to our HTML5 Client, via a web browser, any Client device with any OS anywhere can access a Server PC.</p>

<h2>Highlight Features of TSplus Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Watch out for security features, ease of use and finally efficiency. What is the sense in a product that needs hours of training to get to grips with or to achieve your goals? The application publishing aspect is central here, and the fact it takes an instant to publish apps or assign users is something that makes us proud. Still, you will also find the user settings have been carefully thought out. Nonetheless, it is worth giving some attention to Farm Features, which extends possibilities. You gain total control of your servers regarding web-enabling applications as well as managing your network.</p>

<h2>A Full TSplus Suite Including Security Alerts and Network Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Within and around Remote Access, we have a team of features and products bent on security and efficiency. It may be your connection has no prior protection or that the endpoint lacks a certificate. TSplus is highly concerned by cyber-security so our teams have thought of all this. With TSplus Remote Access, you get valid SSL certificates according to your requirements. Additionally, Two Factor Authentication or, as mentioned above, our all-round cyber-protection, Advanced Security, are available as add-ons to any of our products as well as stand-alone for any other needs. Similarly, TSplus Server Monitoring could be an great extra string to your bow should you need to monitor your servers or websites.</p>

Why <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server monitoring</a> Is Crucial to e-Business?
Business over the internet has expanded by leaps and bounds and continues to do so. Congested websites and networks cause delays, even outages. Website Monitoring Essentials are needed to keep these problems at bay.
<h2>Operational Issues Confronting e-Business Today:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">E-business has become truly global for buyers and sellers alike, thanks to world economies opening up and growing IT possibilities. In addition, the associated problems, which are both technical and non-technical, are not set to slow down.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The prime concern for any e-business is secure and efficient handling of transaction volumes and high response levels. The problem is, slow loading time remains one of the main reasons potential on-line customers will switch web sites. Therefore, long waiting times can prove disastrous.</p>

<h2>Website Loading Times a Central Issue</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Generally, a web site load pattern will vary from hour to hour due to standard work-hours. For example, lunch time and after hours load on an on-line super-store will be more than during working hours. Lengthy response times could result in on-line customers abandoning the cart midway and switching to the competition. These variations in bandwidth and network use and in load patterns means local response times can vary widely from place to place even for the same traffic volumes.</p>

<h2>Need for Website Monitoring Essentials to Keep Watch</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Web site monitoring enables you to know in real time where the bottlenecks are, at any point in time. Constant monitoring is therefore a must to identify problems and initiate remedial steps without loss of time or on-line customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are other problems as well. These relate to web site’s accessibility, availability, security, data integrity and dangers from hackers. Invariably, even with the best managed web sites it can be hard to know what the exact problem is and where! Until informed by a frustrated customer. Clearly, web site owners would prefer to concentrate on challenges posed by their business rather than spending time on these extraneous issues. For every web site, therefore, there is an urgent need for constant monitoring which can alert to specified issues and discrepancies.</p>

<h2>TSplus Server Monitoring as an Essential Tool for a Stable Website</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/features/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> provides simple web site and server monitoring, helping address the issues and concerns raised above. It keeps you informed of the performance of your web sites. You can follow availability and accessibility and therefore highlight any deviations from the supplied norms. All that is left is to analyse these exceptions and takes appropriate remedial steps.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consequently, any IT team can keep their applications running within target parameters and therefore more profitable. All of these detailed performance metrics can be edited into PDF reports. It is easy to choose the watched parameters for a given report. When you wish, Server Monitoring will compile this into a report on which you can then apply company branding. Thus, you can make other teams aware of network peak-times or quiet times, response-time curves, etc.</p>

<h2>TSplus Server Monitoring for Servers as Well as Websites</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Similar items are monitored for servers, so you can see demands on the CPU or RAM, bottlenecks within application servers, user-presence, etc. and respond instantly in accordance. Technicians could use these on test servers and sites also, thus simulating particular circumstances. Such steps will help a business assess the impact of varying levels of use and demand, to tune up their infrastructure even before the web site launch. This results in better planning and preventive action so costly issues can be avoided.</p>

<h2>Simple and Ergonomic Website Monitoring Essentials</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is so intuitive to use Server Monitoring, that once it is installed, it takes mere seconds for monitoring to begin. Rapidly, a technician adds servers, supplies the URLs of the websites they wish to monitor and the process starts immediately. Server Monitoring will then check the web site(s) to ensure availability and the maintenance of acceptable levels of web server performance. It is up to the technician to personalise the norms which require Server Monitoring to send alerts.</p>

<h2>How Server Monitoring Keeps You Informed of Your Websites’ Performance</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Defaults are the like of “disk write usage at 90%”, “CPU at 50% for … minutes” or “Website Response time superior to 500ms for at least 5 minutes”. If any of these fall outside the specified parameters, the notification process starts. Let’s take a simple example. Say Server Monitoring checks the time it takes for the web server to respond to the monitor’s request. It measures against the set acceptable response time (say 5 seconds). If a page takes more time to load, the agent is notified of a possible performance issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Similarly, sites are checked for availability. Server Monitoring notifies the supplied emails addresses or Teams contacts if any problem is detected. This TSplus software, therefore, provides a much needed non-stop monitoring service for smoother running of e-businesses.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on Website Monitoring Essentials</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is clear what the increasing customer preference for doing business on-line and the rapidly expanding global e-commerce implies! It not only means greater opportunities for e-businesses worldwide, but also that web sites need particular conditions to fulfill their potential use. Constant global Website monitoring is integral to the overall e-business strategy. TSplus provides <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">just the right solution</a> to help you make best use of your web sites.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In addition, the associated problems, which are both technical and non-technical, are not set to slow down.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The prime concern for any e-business is secure and efficient handling of transaction volumes and high response levels. The problem is, slow loading time remains one of the main reasons potential on-line customers will switch web sites. Therefore, long waiting times can prove disastrous.<\/p><h2>Website Loading Times a Central Issue<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Generally, a web site load pattern will vary from hour to hour due to standard work-hours. For example, lunch time and after hours load on an on-line super-store will be more than during working hours. Lengthy response times could result in on-line customers abandoning the cart midway and switching to the competition. These variations in bandwidth and network use and in load patterns means local response times can vary widely from place to place even for the same traffic volumes.<\/p><h2>Need for Website Monitoring Essentials to Keep Watch<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Web site monitoring enables you to know in real time where the bottlenecks are, at any point in time. Constant monitoring is therefore a must to identify problems and initiate remedial steps without loss of time or on-line customers.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are other problems as well. These relate to web site\u2019s accessibility, availability, security, data integrity and dangers from hackers. Invariably, even with the best managed web sites it can be hard to know what the exact problem is and where! Until informed by a frustrated customer. Clearly, web site owners would prefer to concentrate on challenges posed by their business rather than spending time on these extraneous issues. For every web site, therefore, there is an urgent need for constant monitoring which can alert to specified issues and discrepancies.<\/p><h2>TSplus Server Monitoring as an Essential Tool for a Stable Website<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/server-monitoring\/features\/\">TSplus Server Monitoring<\/a> provides simple web site and server monitoring, helping address the issues and concerns raised above. It keeps you informed of the performance of your web sites. You can follow availability and accessibility and therefore highlight any deviations from the supplied norms. All that is left is to analyse these exceptions and takes appropriate remedial steps.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Consequently, any IT team can keep their applications running within target parameters and therefore more profitable. All of these detailed performance metrics can be edited into PDF reports. It is easy to choose the watched parameters for a given report. When you wish, Server Monitoring will compile this into a report on which you can then apply company branding. Thus, you can make other teams aware of network peak-times or quiet times, response-time curves, etc.<\/p><h2>TSplus Server Monitoring for Servers as Well as Websites<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Similar items are monitored for servers, so you can see demands on the CPU or RAM, bottlenecks within application servers, user-presence, etc. and respond instantly in accordance. Technicians could use these on test servers and sites also, thus simulating particular circumstances. Such steps will help a business assess the impact of varying levels of use and demand, to tune up their infrastructure even before the web site launch. This results in better planning and preventive action so costly issues can be avoided.<\/p><h2>Simple and Ergonomic Website Monitoring Essentials<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is so intuitive to use Server Monitoring, that once it is installed, it takes mere seconds for monitoring to begin. Rapidly, a technician adds servers, supplies the URLs of the websites they wish to monitor and the process starts immediately. Server Monitoring will then check the web site(s) to ensure availability and the maintenance of acceptable levels of web server performance. It is up to the technician to personalise the norms which require Server Monitoring to send alerts.<\/p><h2>How Server Monitoring Keeps You Informed of Your Websites\u2019 Performance<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Defaults are the like of \u201cdisk write usage at 90%\u201d, \u201cCPU at 50% for \u2026 minutes\u201d or \u201cWebsite Response time superior to 500ms for at least 5 minutes\u201d. If any of these fall outside the specified parameters, the notification process starts. Let\u2019s take a simple example. Say Server Monitoring checks the time it takes for the web server to respond to the monitor\u2019s request. It measures against the set acceptable response time (say 5 seconds). If a page takes more time to load, the agent is notified of a possible performance issue.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Similarly, sites are checked for availability. Server Monitoring notifies the supplied emails addresses or Teams contacts if any problem is detected. This TSplus software, therefore, provides a much needed non-stop monitoring service for smoother running of e-businesses.<\/p><h2>Conclusion on Website Monitoring Essentials<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is clear what the increasing customer preference for doing business on-line and the rapidly expanding global e-commerce implies! It not only means greater opportunities for e-businesses worldwide, but also that web sites need particular conditions to fulfill their potential use. Constant global Website monitoring is integral to the overall e-business strategy. TSplus provides <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/server-monitoring\/\">just the right solution<\/a> to help you make best use of your web sites.<\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

Ways of working and providing IT support have grown more mobile than ever. Today, remote connection to a PC is no longer the mystery it once was and people from all walks of life benefit from it. Also, both PCs and software have progressed since remote control first was used. As a consequence, more options of software are available than ever, as well are more potential interactions and uses. So, if you’ve never done it before, here’s how to remotely control a computer. And <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">a snippet of what TSplus Remote Support has to offer</a>.
<h2>Windows’ Own Remote Access and Control Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Windows PC already hold the wherewithal for remote access and screen sharing. Indeed, Pro versions of Windows for many years now have included RDP, on which much of this communication is usually based. By enabling Remote Desktop Connection, you can use the built RDP to remotely connect to your PC. Nonetheless, protecting and strengthening RDP with extra security to face the Web remains a good step to take. Indeed, it has long been known to be a prime target for cyber-attacks.</p>

<h2>Other Tools to Remotely Control a Computer</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TeamViewer, AnyDesk, Remina are just a few of the many names that pop into mind when I think of screen sharing and remote control. From tested and tried software developers to new products, users are spoilt for choice. Anyhow, the question of the price tag and the simplicity of a tool remains foremost.</p>

<h2>TSplus Alternative to Remotely Control a Computer</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One item in our software suite is Remote Support, <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/features/#remote-assistance">our screen sharing and remote control software</a>. Designed to be straightforward and simple to use, it is also secure. Remote Support is available on subscription, unlike our other licenced software. Maintenance and support teams can work on distant devices, whether attended or unattended. It offers the possibility to securely access, control, troubleshoot, update and support any part of a network from anywhere.</p>

<h2>How To Remotely Control a Computer with TSplus Remote Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Both agent and end-user need to download and run the Remote Support connection client. The connection is initiated by the agent entering in his session the credentials provided by the end-user. Similarly, to end a session, the end-user can simply close the chat box at their end.</p>

<h2>How To Remotely Control a Computer From the agent’s point of view</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the agent’s point of view here is how to provide support.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Run the TSplus Remote Support executable.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the console, generate a connection client to send to the end-user. That is, if they have not already set up Remote Support on their device. The connection client is very easily customised should you want to modify it to bear your company branding.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once the end-user has their Remote Support window in front of them, they will be able to share the ID and password with you so you can validate the connection and begin the session.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Done. You can start work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Remotely Control a Computer From the end-user’s point of view</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the end-user’s point of view, these are the steps.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Either directly download the connection client from <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/installation/#basics">our online Quick-start guide</a> or run the same executable from the invitation your agent has sent you.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote Support will generate a fresh password each time you run it (as in open the Remote Support window). Your support Agent needs your ID and the password provided by the connection client to begin the session.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Done. You Are Sharing Your Screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">NB: You can terminate the session once work is done, or at any time. Ultimately, for security purposes, credentials and termination put the end-user “in charge” rather than the Agent.</p>

<h2>Remote Control Session Underway</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once the Remote Support Session is underway, simply remember that the Agent will do their work by remotely controlling your mouse and other peripherals. Be attentive to let them work without interference, especially if the session aim is troubleshooting. So, now could well be the time to sit back and watch, if your presence is required during the intervention. The chat box is very useful to communicate for instance to ask any questions or to provide additional information.</p>

<h2>Variety of Features and Capabilities with TSplus Remote Access using Windows RDP</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In any case, an agent can remotely control a host device to update its software, or they might need to fix issues. Then again, two or more colleagues could share screens and use remote control technology either to put work in common or even for training. It takes little adaptation to use the features available in remote support software. By extension, many can benefit a team working on a project. For instance, teams can in turn share or control various documents and applications as well as watch all the steps a colleague would take in a particular process.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on How to Remote Control a Computer Using TSplus Remote Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overall, remote control and screen sharing software can be a straightforward process, especially with a service such as TSplus Remote Support.

And <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-support\/\">a snippet of what TSplus Remote Support has to offer<\/a>.","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>Windows\u2019 Own Remote Access and Control Software<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Windows PC already hold the wherewithal for remote access and screen sharing. Indeed, Pro versions of Windows for many years now have included RDP, on which much of this communication is usually based. By enabling Remote Desktop Connection, you can use the built RDP to remotely connect to your PC. Nonetheless, protecting and strengthening RDP with extra security to face the Web remains a good step to take. Indeed, it has long been known to be a prime target for cyber-attacks.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Other Tools to Remotely Control a Computer<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">TeamViewer, AnyDesk, Remina are just a few of the many names that pop into mind when I think of screen sharing and remote control. From tested and tried software developers to new products, users are spoilt for choice. Anyhow, the question of the price tag and the simplicity of a tool remains foremost.<\/p>\n\n<h2>TSplus Alternative to Remotely Control a Computer<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One item in our software suite is Remote Support, <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-support\/features\/#remote-assistance\">our screen sharing and remote control software<\/a>. Designed to be straightforward and simple to use, it is also secure. Remote Support is available on subscription, unlike our other licenced software. Maintenance and support teams can work on distant devices, whether attended or unattended. It offers the possibility to securely access, control, troubleshoot, update and support any part of a network from anywhere.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How To Remotely Control a Computer with TSplus Remote Support<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Both agent and end-user need to download and run the Remote Support connection client. The connection is initiated by the agent entering in his session the credentials provided by the end-user. Similarly, to end a session, the end-user can simply close the chat box at their end.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How To Remotely Control a Computer From the agent\u2019s point of view<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">From the agent\u2019s point of view here is how to provide support.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Run the TSplus Remote Support executable.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the console, generate a connection client to send to the end-user. That is, if they have not already set up Remote Support on their device. The connection client is very easily customised should you want to modify it to bear your company branding.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once the end-user has their Remote Support window in front of them, they will be able to share the ID and password with you so you can validate the connection and begin the session.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Done. You can start work.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How To Remotely Control a Computer From the end-user\u2019s point of view<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">From the end-user\u2019s point of view, these are the steps.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Either directly download the connection client from <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-support\/installation\/#basics\">our online Quick-start guide<\/a> or run the same executable from the invitation your agent has sent you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Remote Support will generate a fresh password each time you run it (as in open the Remote Support window). Your support Agent needs your ID and the password provided by the connection client to begin the session.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Done. You Are Sharing Your Screen.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">NB: You can terminate the session once work is done, or at any time. Ultimately, for security purposes, credentials and termination put the end-user \u201cin charge\u201d rather than the Agent.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Remote Control Session Underway<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once the Remote Support Session is underway, simply remember that the Agent will do their work by remotely controlling your mouse and other peripherals. Be attentive to let them work without interference, especially if the session aim is troubleshooting. So, now could well be the time to sit back and watch, if your presence is required during the intervention. The chat box is very useful to communicate for instance to ask any questions or to provide additional information.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Variety of Features and Capabilities with TSplus Remote Access using Windows RDP<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In any case, an agent can remotely control a host device to update its software, or they might need to fix issues. Then again, two or more colleagues could share screens and use remote control technology either to put work in common or even for training. It takes little adaptation to use the features available in remote support software. By extension, many can benefit a team working on a project. For instance, teams can in turn share or control various documents and applications as well as watch all the steps a colleague would take in a particular process.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion on How to Remote Control a Computer Using TSplus Remote Support<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Overall, remote control and screen sharing software can be a straightforward process, especially with a service such as TSplus Remote Support.

Command lines, Powershell, scripting… If you need to know how to monitor Windows services, all those could mark the path to follow. Yet, as time is scarce, though DIY should be ideal, it is not always the best adapted solution. A simple ready-made yet efficient software tool could be more welcome that a precise tutorial or a new set of skills. <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> at the ready.
<h2>What are Windows Services?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Windows services are generally executables, therefore applications or programs as we know them. The difference is the fact they can be launched directly by the OS as it boots up. They also often have special privileges. This is unlike standard applications which run at the user’s request.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note that Windows services can serve to log events, access files or report errors, to provide access to web-resources or even for services like printing. Yet they can be installed as part of a third party application or driver. Anything from user management to parental control and autosaves, Windows services are useful for such programs as for instance a printer-scanner or a cyber-security suite. To illustrate, cache is a great example of a service: does DNS ring any bells? No DNS service, no cache.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Should you want to see those running on your device, one of the easiest paths is to search “services” in the Windows menu search bar. The window you will open will list Windows services. With admin rights you could also choose when to run a service, start-up or later, automatically or manually. Although, please bear in mind, you first need to know whether altering this status will interfere with proper running of anything crucial.</p>

<h2>What Does Monitoring Windows Services Entail?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, do you have the time to learn what scripts to write, how, where? Are you a technician with the skill and time to set everything up from there? Then, the best thing is to go ahead with it. But the time factor is a constraint that will not be ignored. That is true whether you know how to wield script, cmdlets and more or want to learn.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But! How long will it take you to confidently write lines knowing that your commands are not about to break your machine? If you know the theory, you still have to choose what to type and where to apply it. This depends, according to the services you want to monitor, on which servers, etc. Do you know how to set up alerts in command shell?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, let us say you have set alerts to be sent. You still need to act on them. Drawing conclusions to learn from the data is probably also incumbent to you. So next, you will have to gather all that data and process it. That way, you can draw conclusions and implement changes accordingly. Perhaps this is the biggest variable so far. How long will it take you to go through the data yielded by the monitoring processes you set? It takes time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you’ve processed it (or input it for a software tool to do so), how will you compile then send it? Indeed, you are also likely to want to inform colleagues of data progression, trends, events, conclusions, and more.</p>

<h2>How to Monitor Windows Services - Questions for Planning</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another step when monitoring Windows (or other) services is to know what you plan to watch. Here are some points to clarify. On any given server, what processes are running? Which server and services do you want to monitor? Are you interested in them all or only ones? Who is due to receive the feedback generated here? Which person needs reports on which processes and services? Such planning is needed whether you use command prompts and Powershell or whether you choose a software tool instead.</p>

<h2>Ready-made Monitoring Tool</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/features/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a>, the scripting and programming have been done for you by our team of developers. Services to watch, data targeted and both specific and overall design are examples of matters they have considered. You simply add servers and customise what you wish to include in the reports. In a few clicks, Server Monitoring generates the PDF report containing the data you pinpoint on the servers of your choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You have full control of your environment. And, with its centralized interface, you can monitor all of your servers and websites from one place, for a full understanding. Consequently, you can even anticipate, avoid and prevent potential problems before they impact your operations.</p>

<h2>Super-simple Windows Monitoring Kit</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The admin console is designed to be self-explanatory. We have also thought it out to be pleasantly ergonomic. Its use is browser-like, so anyone who has used Web-browsers can find their feet in seconds. Navigate the menus and go to particular items easily thanks to this attention to detail.</p>

<h2>Easy-to-use Server and Website Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hovers, right or left clicks, navigation is pretty much second nature. These aspects make for software both quick to implement and free of the learning curve that could otherwise be involved. The Quick-start guide contains what you need to start out. Then, for further detail on prerequisites, setup, functionality, etc. the User Guide and FAQ are available from various links on our website.</p>

<h2>Focus on a Key Feature: Process Usage</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Amongst its carefully picked essential features, <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/features/#alerts-management">TSplus Server Monitoring includes "Process Usage"</a>. For each monitored server, you can view a list of all active processes, which includes the topic of today's article, Windows services. Server Monitoring displays (for the selected server) the following indicators in a table: Process name, Username, Memory usage, CPU usage, Bytes received per second, Bytes sent per second.</p>

<h2>To Conclude on How to Monitor Windows Services?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Of course, it is greatly satisfying to do every step of a job ourselves when we can, but money, skill and time can easily be hurdles. So, when time is of the essence, a simple efficient solution is helpful. TSplus has thought of anyone who needs to rapidly obtain an overview of their servers without reinventing the wheel.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>From download to monitoring, a mere few clicks and very little time are necessary with TSplus Server Monitoring. <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">Discover our great value-for-money surveillance software for 15 days for free, no strings attached</a>, and meet your Windows services watching and other monitoring needs.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>

As a network administrator, you probably have a whole lists of tasks. One of these will have to be to oversee RDP access to your servers. For that you need to know how to check who has RDP access to a server. Is it as straightforward task? What does checking user RDP access entail? We will look at all that before seeing <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> at work and any correlated tasks and possibilities.
<h2>RDP User Management in Windows - Some Examples of Tasks</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Managing RDP users in Windows or other remote software or services, some tasks are recurrent. Creating users and then granting them appropriate permissions go as a pair. Then you have the checks in question today. Making sure each user has the access permissions they need to complete their daily work also figures on the list.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These are one tip of an iceberg as complex as your network. Some days will go smoothly. Other days, it’s components, devices and apps, the number of staff and users accessing it, and any other variable that might weigh in and multiply potentials, all come together for something quirky to happen.</p>

<h2>Checking Who has RDP Access to a Server in Windows</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Time to get down to business. Start by accessing the device’s local “Computer Management” via a right click on the start menu. In that window, you can scroll down the side menu within “System Tools”. Expand “Local Users and Groups” and click to access the “Groups” list. Here, you should find all the information you need.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the group “Remote Desktop Users”, those users listed will have been allocated access privileges. “Administrators” on the other hand should each by default have access to a device. Bear in mind that administrators may not automatically be listed in their group while nonetheless normally being granted default access.</p>

<h2>Alternative for Checking Who Has RDP Access to a Server</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Windows proprietary software is useful and functions yet we saw the need for something different and simpler. TSplus Remote Access provides you with a complete management console for all your <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#shared-remote-desktop">application publishing and Web-enabling</a>, for your user profiles and presence management, even for your farm management, amongst other things. Here is how you would perform the above checks in our environment.</p>

<h2>Checking Who has RDP Access to a Server in Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To perform the above checks when using TSplus Remote Access, you can look in the same places as above for the device-based information. You can manage a host of user-related assignments in the "Publish &amp; Assign Applications" settings in Lite mode and the "Application" preferences in Expert mode. On the Home display of the Expert mode, you will see this:</p>
												<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA1.png" alt="Screenshot of TSplus Remote Access admin console &quot;Home&quot;, in Expert Mode. User Management and Sessions menu heading are framed to highlight them." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA1.png 557w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA1-300x198.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA1-18x12.png 18w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" width="557" height="368">
<p style="text-align: left;">Click on the “Session Manager” button to view a list of users. As you can see, the “User Sessions” pane contains basic information for each user, including whether they are active of not. You can actually select any one and impact it with an action of your choice amongst the buttons below the table: Remote Control, Disconnect, Logoff, Send Message or [open] Task Manager.</p>
												<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA2.png" alt="Screenshot of &quot;User Sessions&quot; list for TSplus Remote Access." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA2.png 696w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA2-300x200.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA2-18x12.png 18w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" width="696" height="464">
<p style="text-align: left;">There are extra RDP specific permissions in the "Sessions&gt;Permissions" pane. To test them, you can <a href="https://tsplus.net/download/">download a 15-day trial version of Remote Access</a>. It is fully featured so you can get the scope of its capabilities and discover even those not available under a standard licence.</p>

<h2>Further Possibilities within TSplus Remote Access</h2>
<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA3.png" alt="Screenshot of &quot;Sessions&quot; window of TSplus Remote Access admin console." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA3.png 1248w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA3-300x199.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA3-1024x679.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA3-768x509.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA3-18x12.png 18w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px" width="1248" height="827">
<p style="text-align: left;">Within the Sessions menu, you can perform other user-related tasks such as set a session time limit (ie, how long a disconnected session is left until terminated) and User Reconnection options (Here, users can be allowed one unique session or multiple sessions. A session can be captured so the user connects to the same session each time, or the previous will be terminated and a new one opened.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Session Prelaunch is a feature of which we are particularly proud. Indeed, it enables you to set user sessions to launch in advance or usual work-hours for each user or group. This way, when the user connects, there is no latency whatsoever as their session is already up and waiting for them. This will account to smoother starts to your users' workdays.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To finish, here is the Remote Access “Permissions” pane:</p>
												<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA4.png" alt="Screenshot of &quot;Sessions>Permissions&quot; window of TSplus Remote Access admin console." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA4.png 1251w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA4-300x199.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA4-1024x678.png 1024w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA4-768x508.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/User-Sess-RA4-18x12.png 18w" sizes="(max-width: 1251px) 100vw, 1251px" width="1251" height="828">
<p style="text-align: left;">Setting any of the features you see with care is worthwhile to increase security for your server. Permissions can restrict access to both or one of the categories of users we have mentioned: all users or admin only. Also, it can be brought right down to LAN users alone or no incoming access whatsoever.</p>

<h2>Secure Alternative to Windows Remote Services</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Such simple measures contribute to keeping company data and servers secure and making sure that distant access doesn’t become an inroad for cyber-attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A small Post Scriptum as you may have noticed the third block: “Web Portal Access Restrictions”. Do you know about our <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#connection-modes">HTML5 Web Portal</a>? It is a great RDP-free remote solution for complete cross-device mobility.</p>

<h2>Determining Which Users are Currently Connected to a Server</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Each user may or may not have an active session. As visible above in picture 2, this information is part of the status column of the Remote Access “User Sessions” pane. Should you also want to determine user-status in Windows, you can read further articles in our blog pages. Different topics are addressed each week around remote access, other related IT topics as well as our array of software. Feel free to browse our blog pages and website to discover more.</p>

<h2>To Conclude: How to Check Who Has RDP Access to a Server</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">These are some simple checks to perform, whether within Windows or in Remote Access itself. <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> offers some quick solutions to some of the issues at the source of such checks as "Which users have been granted access permission to this server?". With a few clicks you can setup our software to discover its simplicity and ease-of-use. Finally, a rapid look at our store will give your accountant or finance manager the assurance that this is a remote solution that will not break the bank.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Setting up users into your network involves an important initial step: signing them up. To add a user, you will need to create their user account allowing remote access for their device as well as enabling them access to the server, applications, desktop or anything else they will need to use. Here are the basics of how to create an RDP user for a desktop or server followed by details of the process when you are using <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> as your distant access and app publishing software.
<h2>How to Create an RDP User for a Desktop or Server</h2>
<h2>* Step 1: Create a New User</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Creating a user involves modifying local computer preferences.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">You need to access “Local Users and Groups” within local “System Tools”.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you open “Users”, you should see a list of existing users (Which would be empty but for the default Administrator account if you are just setting up.).</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">There, you are able to right click for a menu where you can click on “New User” and create a username, adding the user’s full name and creating a password.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Closing the new user window will require clicking “Create”.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep a note of the Username somewhere handy. It is needed in step 2.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>* Step 2: Add a User to a Server or Desktop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once the user exists, you can grant them access to all or parts of a server or PC, for example according to their job, tasks and responsibilities. In order to add user permissions, you need to open the Control Panel. Within Systems and Security, “System” has a submenu called “Allow remote access”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">NB: In case you had any doubt about the Windows versions on the device supporting Remote Desktop Protocol, you would be fixed within System and Security. Indeed, Windows Home editions clearly state it is not available and suggest upgrading to a Professional Edition. RDP is one of the principal aspects specific to Pro versions of Windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Click on “Allow remote access” to open the device’s System Properties window and choose the tab “Remote Desktop”. You should see a “Select Users” button which you can click to open the Remote Desktop Users Window. There, click the “Add” button.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is where you need to enter the Username you gave to the user in the Creation step. The users name will get appended to the location when you press “check names”. You can then click “OK” and it the previous window the new user is now existent. There too, click “OK” to validate.</p>

<h2>How to Add Users to TSplus Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Within the ergonomic admin console from which you manage TSplus Remote Access, there are a series of tabs. As for creating users, steps will sound similar to above except they take place with the admin console, in the “System Tools” tab, under “Users and Groups”.</p>
												<img src="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TSplus-RemAcc-users-and-groups.png" alt="Screenshot of &quot;System Tools&quot; tab of TSplus Remote Access admin console with Users and Groups button highlighted." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TSplus-RemAcc-users-and-groups.png 1008w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TSplus-RemAcc-users-and-groups-300x200.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TSplus-RemAcc-users-and-groups-768x511.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TSplus-RemAcc-users-and-groups-18x12.png 18w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" width="1008" height="671">
<p style="text-align: left;">The new window that opens is a local users management space where you can add, amend and remove users or groups. Password setting are here too.</p>

Password settings highlighted." loading="lazy" srcset="https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TSplus-RemAcc-create-users.png 950w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TSplus-RemAcc-create-users-300x229.png 300w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TSplus-RemAcc-create-users-768x586.png 768w, https://tsplus.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TSplus-RemAcc-create-users-16x12.png 16w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" width="950" height="725">
<p style="text-align: left;">For more detail about user creation, <a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/tsplus/quickstart-guide?_gl=1*1fngb5p*_ga*NDE4NjQ5MDMwLjE2NTk5NTEzNzg.*_ga_T4Q0L5SBHM*MTY4MDUyNTc4OC4zNDcuMS4xNjgwNTI1ODIwLjI4LjAuMA..&amp;_ga=2.84034137.1323945607.1680507484-418649030.1659951378#step-2-creating-users">our Quick-start guide</a> or our user-guide are the best places to look.</p>

<h2>Far and Wide With TSplus Remote Access Connections</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">You have a choice of modes of connection with TSplus Remote Access, according to your setup as well as how your users might need to connect. So, the following step will be to enable the connection and assign either one or more apps or a complete desktop to each user or group of users.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These range from the standard mstsc.exe or the Windows client to a portable TSplus RDP client or even lighter: a HTML5 client over our TSplus Web Portal. The later frees your users to connect on just about any device with an Internet connection and a Web browser.</p>

<h2>Assigning Users and Groups to Desktops or Applications</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In a few clicks, you have created your new users. Next, you have wide control of what each user and each group will have at their fingertips once they log in. For today's article, <a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/tsplus/assigning-applications-to-users-or-groups?_gl=1*iyahba*_ga*NDE4NjQ5MDMwLjE2NTk5NTEzNzg.*_ga_T4Q0L5SBHM*MTY4MDUyNTc4OC4zNDcuMS4xNjgwNTI1ODIwLjI4LjAuMA..&amp;_ga=2.42099557.1323945607.1680507484-418649030.1659951378">assigning desktops to users</a> is the more relevant focus.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nonetheless, you could assign a single application or any number of apps to a user or to any group you manage. These applications would open seamlessly on the user's desktop as though it were native to their machine. A great way of making memory-heavy applications available on the flimsiest device. Just the same, you could publish an application to any number of servers and deploy it on your network worldwide with a click.</p>

Technology evolves at a rate of knots these days. Everyone seems to be speaking of this or that improvement to everyday items to which IA has been added. Paying via smartphone is becoming commonplace. Working from any place on any device, also. Amongst all these changes, one element seems stable: the need for security.
Indeed, more available and exposed than ever, IT is no exception. More than ever, whether cloud-based or self-hosted, RDP and other remote access and control possibilities all need security. And where security is concerned, <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security is up to the challenge</a>.
<h2>RDP Security for Business</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of our software products is a simple efficient and, all-importantly, affordable alternative to Microsoft RDS.

This is in spite of a trend of local and global competitors which make two kinds of offers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Too often, security packages are either free but flimsy and ill-adapted or they are expensive, all-singing all-dancing extensive subscriptions. In the face of that, TSplus has chosen to keep to simple permanent licencing with an optional Updates and Support service.</p>

<h2>Variety of Features for Higher Security of RDP and Remote Connections</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Advanced Security bears features like Bruteforce, Homeland, Working Hours, IP management… Such tools make it adaptable to a variety of situations and of business needs and uses. IT managers can set permissions, working hours and other variables according to what users need. Such settings may also be adapted to the tasks, job positions or locations of users or groups. These are just some of the range of features in the Advanced Security tool-kit.</p>

<h2>Endpoint Protection for a Fine-tuned Security Barrier</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can parameter the access levels for different users thanks to “Secure Desktop”, and the same for groups. These precise settings enable varying degrees of security and freedom to suit and reinforce your company’s IT security policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No doubt “Endpoint protection” will also serve you well. Indeed, you can pair specific devices to a particular user account and vice-versa.

When it comes to remote support software, “unattended computers” is a feature that can prove more than handy. What is an unattended remote support session? How is the functionality used? How are they generated or terminated? And especially, how do you go about managing unattended remote sessions? Read on to find out more.
<h2>What are Unattended Remote Support Sessions?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unattended remote sessions are the same as remote sessions, with one very useful difference: the end-user (host) does not need to be present at the time of intervention. Indeed, the connection can take place thanks to prior arrangement made by the host with the support agent. If this is all you needed to refine your knowledge, then feel free to go directly to our user guide section to<a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/remote-support-v3/unattended"> start using TSplus Remote Support unattended sessions</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A remote session enables the agent to control the host device for a range of purposes. The agent sees the host’s screen as though it were his own. An agent can input mouse and keyboard from their device to control the host’s. Additionally, another possibility is to send command lines. Yet other actions are usually available depending on the chosen remote support tool.</p>

<h2>Examples of Situations Adapted to Unattended Remote Support</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some cases when unattended sessions are the ideal solution.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Out of office-hours intervention needs, due for instance to the fact host and agent work different shifts or are in different time-zones.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Troubleshooting, fixes or updates that need to be done while the computer is not otherwise in use.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enabling invisible intervention times which do not impede on the host’s productivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do You Manage Unattended Remote Sessions?</h2>
<h3>From a Host's Standpoint - Configuring Unattended Remote Support</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">End-users are the ones who enable this feature. Consequently, only the host can choose to make their PC available remotely at any time without their presence being required. Follow these steps to enable unattended sessions:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Choose an Unattended Password. This password is reserved for this particular purpose and does not affect your main credentials for Remote Access.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">This done, you need to click the now active button: “Enable Unattended Access”.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">The final configuration step as a host is to share your Remote Support ID plus your unattended access password with your support agent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>From the Agent’s Standpoint – Managing Unattended Remote Sessions</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Agents need a host’s ID and password to activate a remote session, whether attended or unattended. As an agent, using the unattended-specific password will enable you to open an unattended session rather than the temporary attended sort.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Within the agents' admin console, you can each save a list of the computers which you can access remotely. Here, computers are easily added or removed. Also, listed computers are searchable and their information can be amended.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is an option to save a password for those computers with enabled unattended sessions.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">You will notice a green dot or a red one next to each listed device. The green or red dots respectively indicates an available or unavailable PC. For each available PC, “Connect” is your one-click session-launching button.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nonetheless, rather than connecting, you can choose to send a command prompt. <a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/remote-support-v3/computers">Full actions and features are detailed in the user-guide</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Do You End an Unattended Remote Session?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note that end-users are free to change their password at any time. Additionally, they can disable unattended access whenever they chose. Either of these actions will terminate the related live unattended sessions. Otherwise, simply closing the chat box of a temporary remote session will end the connection. Then, in either case, you will need to open a new session  to resume remotely sharing computers.</p>

<h2>To Conclude on Managing Unattended Remote Computers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Unattended access offers a freedom of actions and a flexibility that can ease the strain on any IT team as well as on company wide staff. TSplus Remote Support is so simple to use, it takes moments to get maintenance or training underway. Its unattended computers feature is no exception: rapidly setup, quickly in hand. <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">For more about Remote Support, its security and other features</a> and to start using unattended remote sessions right away, please visit our website.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

Citrix is something of a household name when it comes to remote computing. As a provider, they offer a range of possibilities and solutions for remote work and access: “digital workspace” as the phrase goes. These are generally cloud-hosted and on subscription. Citrix provides distant access to applications, desktops, resources, mainly via what is called virtualization. How does Citrix work?

<p style="text-align: left;">By this method of virtualization, Citrix services deliver virtual applications and virtual desktops to users of remote devices. The process is costly and complex. It involves a panel of layers and possibilities but is also potentially heavy to maintain in time and manpower due to this.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops is what used to be XenApp and XenDesktop, while Citrix Virtual Apps is what was known as XenApp. The latter uses application delivery. Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops, on the other hand, uses virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) to publish entire virtual machines. These are the two principal ways Citrix provides remote access.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One basic thing to note is the fact the applications or desktops do not get installed on the remote device, whichever it may be. The technology used by Citrix or any other provider of remote access or virtualization has one thing in common. Indeed, the virtualized or published items appear on the distant devices but are not hosted there. Citrix Server effectively manages that aspect for Citrix Virtual Apps.</p>

<h2>Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Uses Virtualization – What is That?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The virtualization process extracts the OS, applications, data and user settings from the target server. It then makes it available to the device from which the user is remotely connecting. Actions of access and control are possible according to the security and connection parameters set by the administrators. In one given server (physical or cloud), any number of independent virtual machines can run autonomously. Each of these can support different operating systems and hold a variety of applications in accordance.</p>

<h2>Citrix Virtual Apps Publishes Applications – How Does That Work?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to the Citrix Receiver, the one item users need to install in their device, a user can use remotely whichever of their applications they open. Citrix Virtual Apps lets them open an application and send instructions via mouse and keyboard. In effect, users interact with the visual of the app they see on their screen. <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#shared-remote-desktop">The image on the screen is updated as though it were hosted on the device.</a> Nonetheless, all the processing takes place in the central server which hosts the apps. This streaming method avoids hampering the remote device even with more than one application.</p>

<h2>What is the Difference Between Virtualization and Application Publication?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This highlights one of the main practical differences between the two processes. Published applications share resources in their host server while virtual desktops have individual allocated space. Thus, the central server runs the published applications although they appear seamlessly on the user’s screen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In summary, virtualization involves creating a virtualized environment in which applications are separated from the underlying hardware. Meanwhile, application publication involves "streaming" the appearance of applications from a central location to end-user devices. Both technologies can be used to deliver apps to end-users. Yet, they have different underlying processes and approaches.</p>

<h2>High Potential of Application Publishing Over Virtualization</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Application publication can allow you to run memory-heavy programs on smaller or less powerful devices. This is possible because the application runs on a remote server and only appears on the local device. So, the local device only needs to have enough resources to run the remote display and user data-flow. This can be especially useful for older or less powerful devices with otherwise insufficient resources to natively run the program.</p>

<h2>Extra Information Comparing Virtualization and Application Publication</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, how well you can run a memory-heavy program using virtualization depends on the resources available both on the virtualization server and the device used to access the virtual desktop. To be effective, it requires more resources than application publication. Indeed, a virtual machine needs to run the entire operating system and the applications. Application publication, on the other hand, simply concentrates its work on the chosen application (or set of applications).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Therefore, two conditions need to be met for virtualization to run a memory-heavy program. Firstly, the virtualization server needs enough resources to handle the program. Secondly, the device used to access the virtual desktop requires sufficient resources to run the remote display and user input and output of data. Nonetheless, if resources are limited, then the combination may use excessive processing from an older or less powerful device to handle. <a href="https://tsplus.net/alternatives-to-citrix/">Seize this opportunity to look at Citrix alternatives by clicking here</a>.</p>

<h2>How Does Citrix Work on Less Powerful Devices?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In general, both application publication and virtualization can help extend the life of older or less powerful devices. They do this simply by allowing them to access and run memory-heavy programs remotely. However, virtualising a particular program for a specific device will weigh more heavily on the resources available and any specific requirements of the program than with application publication.</p>

<h2>How to publish Applications to the Web just like Citrix with TSplus</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our software uses application publication to enable remote access. TSplus Remote Access offers various ways to <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/features/#connection-modes">display remote applications and remote desktops</a>. Here are our main display options:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. RDP – Full Desktop: users can access the full Windows Remote Desktop using MSTSC (Microsoft Terminal Services Client) or TSplus 1-click client.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. RemoteApp - Floating Panel (or application panel): remote applications can be displayed in a floating panel. This provides users with a seamless experience, as though applications were run locally.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. RemoteApp – on the Taskbar: users can access remote applications through the TSplus Taskbar. Assigned applications appear on a taskbar within the remote session.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4. HTML5 Web Portal: users can connect to remote applications or full desktops through a customizable HTML5 web portal. Either the applications or the desktop display within the Web browser.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5. TSplus Seamless Client: display only the applications, without showing the desktop, thus providing a seamless user-experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">6. MS RemoteApp Client: this option uses the native Microsoft RemoteApp to display remote applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">7. Windows Client over the TSplus Web Portal: via the TSplus Web Portal, users can access remote applications and desktops through a Windows client.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">8. HTML5 Client over the TSplus Web Portal: users can also access remote applications and desktops through an HTML5 client via the TSplus Web Portal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to this variety of options, administrators can customize the end-user experience according to combined company requirements and user preferences.</p>

<strong>As a system administrator, monitoring your corporate network servers is critical for ensuring the smooth operation of your organization's IT infrastructure. Fortunately, with the right tools and procedures in place, server monitoring for business can become a piece of cake.</strong> With <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a>, you can stay on top of server performance and website responsiveness and prevent issues from turning into serious problems. In this guide, we'll discuss the steps you can take to monitor your corporate network servers effectively.
<h2>Step 1: Choose the Right Server Monitoring Tool</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first step in monitoring your corporate network servers is selecting the right tool for the job. At TSplus, we offer an advanced Server Monitoring solution that enables you to track server performance in real-time and receive alerts when issues arise. With our tool, you can monitor server CPU usage, disk space, memory consumption and other critical metrics. This way, you can set up automatic remediation actions to keep your servers running smoothly.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Configure Server Monitoring for Your Business</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you have chosen the right server monitoring tool, the next step is to configure it to meet your specific needs. With TSplus Server Monitoring, it is easy to add new servers or websites, to modify or remove them as needs evolve, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can for example customize monitoring thresholds, choose for which servers and configure alert notifications. Such tools mean you and your team will be made aware of any issues as they arise. By tailoring your monitoring settings to your organization's unique requirements, you also ensure that you are only alerted when critical events occur and minimize false alarms.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Monitor Server Performance</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With your server monitoring tool configured, you are ready to begin monitoring your network servers in real-time. Check your monitoring dashboard regularly to ensure that servers and websites are operating within expected parameters and look for any warning signs that indicate potential issues. If you notice any anomalies, investigate them further to determine the root cause and take appropriate action.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Use Historical Data for Analysis</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One goal of real-time monitoring is to gather regular precise historical data about the different parts of your network. Nevertheless, it is important to use that historical data for trend analysis and forecasting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With TSplus Server Monitoring, you can access this data. From it, generate reports that help you identify patterns in server performance over time. Then, use these reports and results to optimize server resources, plan for future capacity needs and identify potential issues before they become critical.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Stay Up-to-Date with Server Monitoring Best Practice</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As technology and security threats continue to evolve, something important is to stay up-to-date with server monitoring best practice. At TSplus, we regularly update our Server Monitoring tool with the latest features and security enhancements. This helps you, as customers, keep in step with technology. It also makes sure our software remains compatible in spite of any changes to the Windows environment and such related programs. So, our Updates and Support Service is a highly valuable add-on.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, we maintain a comprehensive user guide for each of our products. This works hand-in-hand with each Quick-start guide. Apart from these readily available online tools, you have access to our technical support to help you get the most out of your server monitoring solution.</p>

<h2>To Conclude on Server monitoring for Business</h2>

At TSplus, we offer an advanced Server Monitoring solution that enables you to track server performance in real-time and receive alerts when issues arise. With our tool, you can monitor server CPU usage, disk space, memory consumption and other critical metrics. This way, you can set up automatic remediation actions to keep your servers running smoothly.<\/p><h2>Step 2: Configure Server Monitoring for Your Business<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once you have chosen the right server monitoring tool, the next step is to configure it to meet your specific needs. With TSplus Server Monitoring, it is easy to add new servers or websites, to modify or remove them as needs evolve, and more.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can for example customize monitoring thresholds, choose for which servers and configure alert notifications.

Nevertheless, it is important to use that historical data for trend analysis and forecasting.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With TSplus Server Monitoring, you can access this data. From it, generate reports that help you identify patterns in server performance over time. Then, use these reports and results to optimize server resources, plan for future capacity needs and identify potential issues before they become critical.<\/p><h2>Step 5: Stay Up-to-Date with Server Monitoring Best Practice<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As technology and security threats continue to evolve, something important is to stay up-to-date with server monitoring best practice.

Establishing a secure connection to a server is essential to protect sensitive information from being intercepted, accessed or stolen by unauthorized users. There are several methods to establish a secure connection to a server, depending on the type of connection and services you need. In this article, we will explore some common methods and best practice for securing remote connections. That done, we will look at how <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> enhances any remote connection setup. Read on if you want to know how to establish a secure connection to a server.
<h2>How to Establish a Secure Connection to a Server: 5 Common Methods</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here is a brief description of each of five quite common methods for securing remote connections.</p>

<h3>1. SSH</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">One method for establishing a secure connection is using Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a cryptographic network protocol with three layers (data and communication transport, authentication and connection). It provides secure remote login and command execution on a server. The encrypted communication tunnel it creates is secure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To connect using SSH, you need an SSH client. For macOS and Linux, it is in the built-in terminal. Now, for Windows, you will need a third party client if you are on an older version but it is generally built in since Windows 10. Users can enter the server’s IP address or hostname, port number and authentication details for secure access.</p>

<h3>2. VPN</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another method is using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that creates an encrypted tunnel between the user's device and the server. This allows for secure communication over the internet. To set up a VPN connection, users will need VPN client software and the VPN server’s configuration details. Follow the instructions provided by your VPN provider or network administrator to configure and connect to the VPN.</p>

<h3>3. HTTPS</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is another method for establishing a secure connection between the user's web browser and a web server. Ensure that the URL starts with https:// instead of http:// when accessing a website or web service. This has become standard, so modern web browsers display a padlock icon in the address bar to indicate a secure connection.</p>

<h3>4. SSL/TLS</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with SSL/TLS can be used to secure the connection between the client and server when using RDP to connect to a remote server. To configure the Remote Desktop Gateway server for SSL/TLS authentication and encryption, users can use SSL/TLS certificates. Ensure that the Remote Desktop Connection client is set to use SSL/TLS security.</p>

<h3>5. FTPS or SFTP</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, when transferring files to/from a server, you have the option of using File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) instead of regular FTP. FTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption, while SFTP uses SSH for secure file transfers. Use a compatible client like FileZilla to connect to the server using the appropriate protocol, server address, port, and authentication credentials.</p>

<h2>Drawback to Using Only One Method to Establish a Secure Connection to a Server</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The above methods function. Yet, they lack a broader aspect: overall management. For one off or individual use, each has benefits. Nevertheless, if you plan on extending them company-wide, some automation is needed. You will also gain from a capacity to oversee the whole network and make sure everything remains sturdily protected.</p>

Read on if you want to know how to establish a secure connection to a server.<\/p>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>How to Establish a Secure Connection to a Server: 5 Common Methods<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here is a brief description of each of five quite common methods for securing remote connections.<\/p>\n\n<h3>1. SSH<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One method for establishing a secure connection is using Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a cryptographic network protocol with three layers (data and communication transport, authentication and connection). It provides secure remote login and command execution on a server. The encrypted communication tunnel it creates is secure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To connect using SSH, you need an SSH client. For macOS and Linux, it is in the built-in terminal. Now, for Windows, you will need a third party client if you are on an older version but it is generally built in since Windows 10. Users can enter the server\u2019s IP address or hostname, port number and authentication details for secure access.<\/p>\n\n<h3>2. VPN<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Another method is using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that creates an encrypted tunnel between the user's device and the server. This allows for secure communication over the internet. To set up a VPN connection, users will need VPN client software and the VPN server\u2019s configuration details. Follow the instructions provided by your VPN provider or network administrator to configure and connect to the VPN.<\/p>\n\n<h3>3. HTTPS<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is another method for establishing a secure connection between the user's web browser and a web server. Ensure that the URL starts with https:\/\/ instead of http:\/\/ when accessing a website or web service. This has become standard, so modern web browsers display a padlock icon in the address bar to indicate a secure connection.<\/p>\n\n<h3>4. SSL\/TLS<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with SSL\/TLS can be used to secure the connection between the client and server when using RDP to connect to a remote server. To configure the Remote Desktop Gateway server for SSL\/TLS authentication and encryption, users can use SSL\/TLS certificates. Ensure that the Remote Desktop Connection client is set to use SSL\/TLS security.<\/p>\n\n<h3>5. FTPS or SFTP<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, when transferring files to\/from a server, you have the option of using File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) instead of regular FTP. FTPS uses SSL\/TLS encryption, while SFTP uses SSH for secure file transfers. Use a compatible client like FileZilla to connect to the server using the appropriate protocol, server address, port, and authentication credentials.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Drawback to Using Only One Method to Establish a Secure Connection to a Server<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The above methods function. Yet, they lack a broader aspect: overall management. For one off or individual use, each has benefits. Nevertheless, if you plan on extending them company-wide, some automation is needed. You will also gain from a capacity to oversee the whole network and make sure everything remains sturdily protected.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Advantages of TSplus Advanced Security in Establishing Secure Connections to Servers<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/\">TSplus Advanced Security<\/a> provides a range of security features for securing connections to servers.

In today's digital age, businesses require robust and reliable server infrastructure to keep up with the increasing demands of their users. Virtual servers offer an innovative solution to this challenge. In this article, we will discuss the topic "What is a virtual server?". We will also examine how it works and some of its benefits and disadvantages. And finally, we will find out more about the importance of monitoring servers and how <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> can benefit your set-up.
<h2>What is a Virtual Server and How Does One Work?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are two types of servers for the purposes of this article: virtual and physical. Physical servers are actual computers you have on your premises, tangible and solid. A virtual server is a software-based server that emulates the functionality of a physical server by using virtualization technology. It is non-tangible and a number of these may cohabitate in one same physical server.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A virtual server runs as a virtual machine on a physical host computer, sharing the resources within it (such as CPU, memory, storage and network). Hypervisors, such as VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V, or KVM, are used to create and manage virtual servers. These enable the creation of multiple isolated virtual environments on the same physical hardware.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Virtual Servers:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Virtual servers offer several advantages over physical servers. These include cost savings, scalability, flexibility, improved resource utilisation and easier management. With virtual servers, businesses can reduce their hardware, power, and cooling costs. Additionally, they will easily scale up or down. Also, you can separately run different operating systems and applications within the same physical host. Finally, they enable better use of resources and simplify certain server management tasks.</p>

<h3>Here is a little more detail about these advantages, should it be of interest:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. Improved resource utilisation: virtualization enables better use of physical resources by allowing multiple virtual servers to share the same hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. Cost savings: it reduces the need for multiple physical servers, leading to lower needs (therefore in turn cost) for hardware, power and cooling.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. Scalability: without the need for additional physical hardware, virtual servers can be easily scaled up or down by adjusting resources such as CPU, memory and storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4. Flexibility: multiple virtual servers can run different operating systems and applications on the same physical host. This, for example, allows greater flexibility in managing workloads.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5. Easier management: virtual servers can be quickly deployed, backed up and restored, thus simplifying server management tasks.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of Virtual Servers:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">While virtual servers offer a lot of benefits, there are also some disadvantages to consider. Some of the most common are performance issues, resource allocation dependence on underlying software and security concerns.</p>

<h3>Here are some further details about each of those:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. Performance. Virtual servers can provide decent performance for most applications. Nonetheless, they may not be ideal for applications that require high-performance computing or high I/O operations. In these cases, a physical server may be a better option.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. Dependence on the underlying hardware. Virtual servers are dependent on the hardware on which they run. If the underlying hardware fails, it can cause issues with the virtual server. This can be mitigated by using redundancy and failover systems, but it remains a potential disadvantage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. Resource allocation. While virtual servers allow for resource allocation and scaling, it's important to monitor resource usage carefully. If one virtual server is too greedy in resources, it can affect the performance of other virtual servers on the same physical machine.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4. Security. Virtual servers can be vulnerable to security risks, just like physical servers. However, with virtual servers, there is also the added risk of security breaches at the hypervisor level. This can unfortunately affect multiple virtual servers at once.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In comparison to other types of servers, virtual servers generally offer more flexibility and cost savings than physical servers, as they allow for more efficient use of hardware resources. However, it can be worth noting that they may not be as performant as dedicated servers. They may also not be suitable for certain high-performance computing tasks.</p>

<h2>Self-hosted Virtual Servers or Cloud Based Services?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is worth noting that virtual servers can be hosted on premises or remotely. Hosted in dedicated server farms, these remote Cloud servers also offer many of the benefits of virtual servers. They certainly won't involve the hand-on day-to-day upkeep of on-premises servers. Someone else, some place else will do that. On the other hand, they may come with additional costs for data transfer and storage since they are generally provided on subscription, as a service. They also raise questions of data security and privacy.</p>

<h2>TSplus Server Monitoring for Physical and Virtual Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Server and network monitoring is an essential aspect of managing a virtual server infrastructure. In fact, it is paramount whether you use virtual servers, physical or both. Indeed, there are many aspects of server usage which need surveillance lest the server or network under-perform or, worse, crash.</p>

<h2>To Conclude on “What is a Virtual Server?”</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Virtual Servers are a positive use of server resources and bring several benefits. According to your needs and usage, to your budget and other factors, you may choose virtual servers, physical servers, both, and you may host them yourself or have them “on loan”. Importantly, whatever the type of server, it is essential to monitor and keep it running optimally.</p>

This can unfortunately affect multiple virtual servers at once.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In comparison to other types of servers, virtual servers generally offer more flexibility and cost savings than physical servers, as they allow for more efficient use of hardware resources. However, it can be worth noting that they may not be as performant as dedicated servers. They may also not be suitable for certain high-performance computing tasks.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Self-hosted Virtual Servers or Cloud Based Services?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is worth noting that virtual servers can be hosted on premises or remotely. Hosted in dedicated server farms, these remote Cloud servers also offer many of the benefits of virtual servers. They certainly won't involve the hand-on day-to-day upkeep of on-premises servers. Someone else, some place else will do that. On the other hand, they may come with additional costs for data transfer and storage since they are generally provided on subscription, as a service. They also raise questions of data security and privacy.<\/p>\n\n<h2>TSplus Server Monitoring for Physical and Virtual Servers<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Server and network monitoring is an essential aspect of managing a virtual server infrastructure.

According to your needs and usage, to your budget and other factors, you may choose virtual servers, physical servers, both, and you may host them yourself or have them \u201con loan\u201d.

In today's technological age, remote access is a critical part of modern business. It offers many benefits to organizations of all sizes. Yet, the ability to remotely access and control someone else's computer has also increased the need to implement robust security measures to protect computer and server that are brought to contact with the Web. Indeed, while it may be useful in certain situations, remote access and control can also pose a serious security risk if used maliciously.

Fortunately, there are measures you can take to protect your computer and server from external control. One such measure is <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a>. So for more about how to control someone else’s computer and how to avoid malicious persons controlling yours, read on.
<h2>How to Control Someone Else’s Computer or How to Avoid Malicious Persons Controlling Yours</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is no denying the usefulness and the potential vulnerabilities of remote access. As developer of sturdy, security-aware remote access and remote control software products, TSplus is no stranger to cyber-threats.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Still, there is no need to worry so long as good care is taken to use correct internet security measures, especially when remotely accessing and controlling our own and other computers and servers. To this avail, TSplus Advanced Security offers a range of advanced security features to protect your computer and server from unauthorized access.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Advanced Security features include: intelligent protection against brute-force attacks, working hours, and protection against known vulnerabilities. However, it is worth remembering they do not exempt companies or users from maintaining a strong password policy. With these features in place, you can easily control another computer remotely from anywhere in the world without compromising its security.</p>

<h2>How to Control Someone Else's Computer</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To control someone else's computer, you need to have the necessary permissions or authorization to access their device. Once you have that, you can use remote desktop software like TSplus Remote Support to control the other computer. Or you may access the apps and data via Remote Access for purposes of application and desktop publishing or of deploying software over a wider IT infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With remote desktop software, you can easily control the other computer as if you were sitting in front of it. This type of software is particularly useful for IT support teams. Indeed, it allows them to diagnose and fix issues on user's computers without having to be physically present.</p>

<h2>Why Avoid Malicious Persons Controlling Your PC?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consequently to the trust extended by such potential, it is paramount to avoid potential hackers remotely controlling your computer to prevent any damage to or theft of your data. Malicious persons who gain access to your computer can steal sensitive information, install malware, or even use your computer for illegal activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thus, to prevent this from happening, you need to take proactive steps to safeguard your computer from external attacks. Businesses and larger enterprises are amongst the prime targets. This makes it all the more important to be thorough when securing our company data and IT infrastructures.</p>

<h2>How to Avoid Malicious Persons Controlling Your IT Devices</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To avoid malicious persons taking control of your computer, here are a few steps you can take.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Firstly, you should install reliable antivirus software to protect your computer from known vulnerabilities and malware.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Secondly, block any known malicious IPs and set up ransomware protection.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thirdly, put in place such restrictions as what times someone can connect, where from, lower the number of failed password attempts, pair known endpoints with their relevant user IDs.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fourthly, tailor security clearances and permissions to appropriate users and groups.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>TSplus Advanced Security Against Cyber Attacks</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, how about downloading and configuring one simple product? <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/features/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> brings together the members of this winning team. In fact, with the likes of brute-force defence, homeland restriction, working hours, endpoints, and so much more, it provides comprehensive security for any IT infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The software also includes powerful protection against ransomware and other malicious hacking attempts. Its proactive defense mechanism scans for known vulnerabilities and automatically blocks any attempts to exploit them. Therefore, TSplus Advanced Security offers robust protection against cyber attacks and unauthorized access.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, one last tip. Keep your software updated to the latest versions and promptly install any security patches or updates to prevent any known vulnerabilities. Hence our option to subscribe for ongoing Support and Updates services along with your TSplus software licence.</p>

<h2>Strong Passwords and Two Factor Authentication as Ongoing Essential Protection</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nonetheless, strong passwords and <a href="https://tsplus.net/two-factor-authentication/">two-factor authentication</a> remain an essential part of any ongoing protection against external attacks. Combined, a strong password policy combined and two-factor authentication measures make it much harder for hackers to gain access to your computer or data. Indeed, two-factor authentication requires a second means of authentication in addition to the password. These can be a fingerprint, facial recognition or a code sent to the user's mobile phone.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on How to Access and Control Other Computers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Overall, in the right hands, remote access and control are central to the daily running of IT parks and many businesses worldwide. IT managers and admins can confirm this with how much of their work is done remotely. Any client who has seen their computer being fixed or updated will concur. This goes for whether they were in front of it at the time or away from their desk for any reason. Clearly, remote access has freed work-forces globally and given employers new horizons, while also broadened inherent risks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important to remember that the security of your computers and servers is essential to protecting your company information and ensuring that nothing is compromised. By implementing TSplus Advanced Security, you can be assured that your computer and servers are protected from external attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The software offers peace of mind and greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your network and any sensitive data. With our 15-day free trial, you can see for yourself how <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a>, will restore your confidence that your system is secure and your data protected from external control.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It offers many benefits to organizations of all sizes. Yet, the ability to remotely access and control someone else's computer has also increased the need to implement robust security measures to protect computer and server that are brought to contact with the Web. Indeed, while it may be useful in certain situations, remote access and control can also pose a serious security risk if used maliciously.<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Fortunately, there are measures you can take to protect your computer and server from external control. One such measure is <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/\">TSplus Advanced Security<\/a>. So for more about how to control someone else\u2019s computer and how to avoid malicious persons controlling yours, read on.<\/p>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>How to Control Someone Else\u2019s Computer or How to Avoid Malicious Persons Controlling Yours<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There is no denying the usefulness and the potential vulnerabilities of remote access. As developer of sturdy, security-aware remote access and remote control software products, TSplus is no stranger to cyber-threats.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Still, there is no need to worry so long as good care is taken to use correct internet security measures, especially when remotely accessing and controlling our own and other computers and servers. To this avail, TSplus Advanced Security offers a range of advanced security features to protect your computer and server from unauthorized access.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Advanced Security features include: intelligent protection against brute-force attacks, working hours, and protection against known vulnerabilities. However, it is worth remembering they do not exempt companies or users from maintaining a strong password policy. With these features in place, you can easily control another computer remotely from anywhere in the world without compromising its security.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How to Control Someone Else's Computer<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To control someone else's computer, you need to have the necessary permissions or authorization to access their device. Once you have that, you can use remote desktop software like TSplus Remote Support to control the other computer. Or you may access the apps and data via Remote Access for purposes of application and desktop publishing or of deploying software over a wider IT infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With remote desktop software, you can easily control the other computer as if you were sitting in front of it. This type of software is particularly useful for IT support teams. Indeed, it allows them to diagnose and fix issues on user's computers without having to be physically present.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why Avoid Malicious Persons Controlling Your PC?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Consequently to the trust extended by such potential, it is paramount to avoid potential hackers remotely controlling your computer to prevent any damage to or theft of your data. Malicious persons who gain access to your computer can steal sensitive information, install malware, or even use your computer for illegal activities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Thus, to prevent this from happening, you need to take proactive steps to safeguard your computer from external attacks. Businesses and larger enterprises are amongst the prime targets. This makes it all the more important to be thorough when securing our company data and IT infrastructures.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How to Avoid Malicious Persons Controlling Your IT Devices<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To avoid malicious persons taking control of your computer, here are a few steps you can take.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Firstly, you should install reliable antivirus software to protect your computer from known vulnerabilities and malware.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Secondly, block any known malicious IPs and set up ransomware protection.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Thirdly, put in place such restrictions as what times someone can connect, where from, lower the number of failed password attempts, pair known endpoints with their relevant user IDs.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Fourthly, tailor security clearances and permissions to appropriate users and groups.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>TSplus Advanced Security Against Cyber Attacks<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, how about downloading and configuring one simple product? <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/advanced-security\/features\/\">TSplus Advanced Security<\/a> brings together the members of this winning team. In fact, with the likes of brute-force defence, homeland restriction, working hours, endpoints, and so much more, it provides comprehensive security for any IT infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The software also includes powerful protection against ransomware and other malicious hacking attempts. Its proactive defense mechanism scans for known vulnerabilities and automatically blocks any attempts to exploit them. Therefore, TSplus Advanced Security offers robust protection against cyber attacks and unauthorized access.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, one last tip. Keep your software updated to the latest versions and promptly install any security patches or updates to prevent any known vulnerabilities. Hence our option to subscribe for ongoing Support and Updates services along with your TSplus software licence.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Strong Passwords and Two Factor Authentication as Ongoing Essential Protection<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Nonetheless, strong passwords and <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/two-factor-authentication\/\">two-factor authentication<\/a> remain an essential part of any ongoing protection against external attacks. Combined, a strong password policy combined and two-factor authentication measures make it much harder for hackers to gain access to your computer or data. Indeed, two-factor authentication requires a second means of authentication in addition to the password. These can be a fingerprint, facial recognition or a code sent to the user's mobile phone.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion on How to Access and Control Other Computers<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Overall, in the right hands, remote access and control are central to the daily running of IT parks and many businesses worldwide. IT managers and admins can confirm this with how much of their work is done remotely. Any client who has seen their computer being fixed or updated will concur. This goes for whether they were in front of it at the time or away from their desk for any reason. Clearly, remote access has freed work-forces globally and given employers new horizons, while also broadened inherent risks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is important to remember that the security of your computers and servers is essential to protecting your company information and ensuring that nothing is compromised. By implementing TSplus Advanced Security, you can be assured that your computer and servers are protected from external attacks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The software offers peace of mind and greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your network and any sensitive data.

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a Microsoft protocol that allows users to connect to a remote Windows desktop or server over a network connection. One of the main considerations when using RDP concerns sessions. Many admins want to track the number of active or idle concurrent sessions and users on a given Windows or Linux server. The question "how many RDP sessions on a Windows server?" is bound to have cropped up on your work menu. In this article, we will discuss the part <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> has to play in your daily management of RDP sessions and network usage as well as how it helps with tasks such as load balancing or performance reporting.
<h2>Monitoring RDP Sessions on Your Windows Servers</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Server Monitoring is a powerful tool that provides real-time monitoring and management of Windows servers and Websites, including RDP sessions.

<p style="text-align: left;">As an IT technician or administrator, you can use TSplus Server Monitoring to view the number of active RDP sessions on your servers. Other information includes overseeing the users connected to each session, the amount of bandwidth being used, and more. This information can help a variety of IT profiles manage server resources more effectively. How better to ensure that all users have access to the resources they need.</p>

<h2>Graphs and Reports from Real-Time Monitoring Data</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Server Monitoring also includes advanced network monitoring capabilities. Administrators can monitor network traffic in real-time, identify network bottlenecks and troubleshoot network issues before they impact user productivity. This is particularly important when it comes to RDP sessions, as network performance can have a significant impact on the user experience.</p>

<h2>Load Balancing for a Smooth Running Network and Websites</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition to monitoring RDP sessions and network usage, TSplus Server Monitoring also supports load balancing. Load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes overloaded.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/features/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a>, administrators can configure load balancing rules based on a variety of criteria, such as server load, network utilization, and user location. This helps ensure that all users not only have access to whichever resources they need but also whenever they need them, plus, all importantly, regardless of the server to which they are connected.</p>

<h2>Unlimited RDP Sessions on Your Windows Server with TSplus Remote Access and Remote Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With TSplus Server Monitoring, you can opt for 1, 5 or 10 servers when you choose which license to purchase. Now, it is important to remember that the number of RDP sessions on your servers are directly dependent on the number of users and of concurrent sessions possible with the remote access and remote control software you give your infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Therefore, small businesses will not be out of budget with our smaller TSplus Remote Access and Remote Support licences and subscriptions. Meanwhile, large organisations with extensive support and IT teams will also find the capacity to suit their breadth.Indeed, our editions and bundles rise to 100 concurrent connexions and unlimited users to match larger companies' needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Furthermore, since TSplus has its own servers in strategic points around the globe, this makes for fast and versatile remote control provision wherever you are.</p>

<h2>Linux-Compatible Server Monitoring Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Within the TSplus Server Monitoring console, you can easily add Linux or Windows servers alike by clicking on the relevant icon. This is one of our development team’s most recent additions to the software. Indeed, being able to centralise the surveillance of different types of servers in one tool is important to many.</p>

<h2>To Conclude on Number of RDP Sessions on a Windows Server</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In conclusion, TSplus Server Monitoring provides powerful tools for managing RDP sessions and network usage on Windows and Linux servers. With real-time monitoring, advanced network monitoring capabilities and load balancing, TSplus Server Monitoring helps ensure that administrators can effectively manage server resources and provide a high-quality user experience. Whether you are managing a small business or working for a large enterprise, <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring is an essential tool</a> for ensuring the optimal performance of your Windows server environment and you can test it for free.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Seeking an Alternative to RDS for PC?</h2>

<h2>Simplest Interface for Clients Without RDS Experience</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As well as the complete admin interface window, Remote Support has a Lite console.

Another action available in the Lite interface is change of password. And, should the client wish to end the connection for any reason, all they need do is close the chat box.</p>

With the work landscape evolving, remote work has become the new norm for many organisations. However, along with the convenience and flexibility that remote access offers, there are also increased cybersecurity risks to be addressed. Protecting devices, data, and applications from cyber threats is crucial for both companies and employees.

While various measures can be taken to enhance remote work security, one effective solution remains the implementation of a reliable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) defender tool. This article will explore the significance of remote access security and highlight how <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a>, a leading solution in this field, can help safeguard remote work environments. So read on since our software trial gives you 15-days free RDP defender tool for remote access security.
<h2>The Importance of RDP Defender Tools in Remote Access Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote working introduces new vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks, making it essential for organizations to prioritize cybersecurity. Breaches involving remote work tend to be more costly, with the average cost of a breach increasing significantly. This prevalence of distant working forces companies to find ways to mitigate the consequent risks. Thus, companies need to raise awareness and establish a culture of cybersecurity among their employees.</p>

<h2>Making Cybersecurity a Company-wide Business</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Creating a culture of cybersecurity is crucial for remote workers to feel empowered and responsible for maintaining the security of their remote work setups. It is no longer sufficient to rely solely on the IT department for cybersecurity. Organisation leaders should set an example in promoting awareness of threats related to remote working.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Providing continuous training on the issue can help employees know where to start and own the solutions. By fostering a culture where cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, employees are more likely to follow best practice. They will also be better able to promptly report any suspicious activities.</p>

<h2>Implementing Virtual Private Networks (VPN)</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One step that can enhance remote work security is to ensure that employees have access to a secure network for all company-related tasks. The use of public wireless networks for conducting company work should be prohibited. Some companies opt for a VPN to cater for situations where employees need to work outside their homes. Combined with Transport Layer Security (TLS) this can create a secure network, regardless of the location. Thus, employees can work efficiently while minimizing the risk of data breaches.</p>

<h2>Addressing Home Router and Device Password Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Employees need to be aware of how important it is to change default passwords on their home routers and other devices. Leaving default passwords makes it easier for cyber-criminals to exploit the network, as they are easy to guess. Additionally, requiring employees to password protect all the devices they use for company business is a fundamental security measure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the event of a lost or stolen device, strong unsaved passwords and combined security measures can make the difference, preventing hacking. Some organizations make the use of biometric passwords (fingerprints or facial recognition) mandatory.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Immediately reporting the loss of a device to the IT department enables swift action. This ranges from <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/features/#endpoint-protection">remotely locking the device</a> and wiping it, to changing all possible passwords, thus reducing the risk of data breaches. Regular reminders, workshops and training refreshers can help ensure that employees stay actively involved in maintaining the security of their home networks.</p>

<h2>Establishing Remote Work Cybersecurity Policies</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once employees are trained on cybersecurity best practices, it is essential to document these guidelines in a written policy. Each employee should sign it. Reviewing a policy annually during performance evaluations will reinforce its importance. This should keep it fresh in employees' minds, encouraging adherence to security protocols. The policy should also be simple and clear. And it should cover items such as encryption requirements, secure network usage, and any restrictions on the use of personal devices for work purposes.</p>

<h2>Implementing Anti-Malware Software to Defend RDP and Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">All devices used for company data, including personal laptops and mobile phones, should have reliable anti-malware software installed. Regular software updates and patching are crucial to ensure protection against the latest threats. Neglecting to update even a single software program significantly increases the risk of cyber-attacks or breaches. Thus, employees should be educated on the importance of keeping their devices up to date with the latest security patches.</p>

<h2>Mitigating Phishing Risks for Greater Remote Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to remote workers, as they may be more susceptible to falling for scams when working in relaxed environments. Training employees to recognize and avoid phishing scams, such as not clicking on unknown links or downloading files from unknown sources, can greatly reduce the likelihood of successful attacks. Clear instructions on how to report phishing attempts should also be provided to employees.</p>

<h2>Introducing One Solution for secure RDP: TSplus Advanced Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">While implementing the aforementioned security measures is crucial, having a dedicated solution to protect remote access can further enhance security. <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> is an exceptional tool that provides all-round protection for remote access environments. It offers multiple layers of security, including brute-force attack defence, IP filtering and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One key feature is that you can lock devices to users and vice-versa, so that a stolen device can in no way be used to access another account than the appropriate one. It is also easy to add-on two-factor authentication. As an RDP Defender tool, TSplus Advanced Security can effectively <a href="https://tsplus.net/pricing/advanced-security/#ransomware-protection">detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts</a>, ensuring a secure remote work environment. These features and more make TSplus Advanced Security a robust and dependable protection for RDP and remote infrastructures.</p>

<h2>Conclusion on Free RDP Defender Tools for Remote Access Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As remote work continues to be the standard mode of operation for many organizations, prioritizing cybersecurity in remote environments is of utmost importance. Protecting devices, data, and applications should be a shared responsibility, remember how empowering employees to become their own cybersecurity experts will actively contribute to maintaining a secure remote work environment for your company.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By implementing the recommended security measures, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks.

I will highlight how our own <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring can make the difference</a> in your surveillance and communication for the whole of your network.
<h2>What is network server monitoring?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Network server monitoring is a critical practice for businesses to ensure the optimal performance, availability and security of their network servers. It refers to the practice of actively monitoring and managing network servers within an organization. The surveillance covers the performance, availability, and security of each server and often of the afferent website. It involves using specialised tools and techniques to collect and analyse data related to these.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consequently, server health, resource usage, network connectivity and security incidents are not only watched. Information is also gathered on the status of each of these. Indeed, by drawing conclusions from the data collected in this process, companies can adjust their servers, networks, etc. to improve. By monitoring network servers, businesses can gain valuable insights into their infrastructure's overall health. Additionally, they can proactively detect and address issues and ensure the efficiency of critical systems and applications.</p>

<h2>What Does IT Administration Aim to Achieve with Good Monitoring?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The primary goal of network server monitoring is to maintain optimal server performance and minimise downtime. It enables administrators to track key performance indicators such as CPU utilisation, memory usage, disk space availability and network traffic. These metrics are generally monitored in real-time or on a scheduled basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This enables administrators to identify potential bottlenecks, predict resource requirements and take proactive measures to optimise server performance. Furthermore, network server monitoring plays a crucial role in ensuring the availability and reliability of server resources. A fluid network depends on this. Surveillance helps detect and alert administrators about service failures, hardware malfunctions or network connectivity issues. In turn, by receiving timely notifications, IT teams can quickly respond to these incidents.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thus, good network monitoring paves the way to troubleshoot problems and minimise their impact on business operations. Analysis can even help plan for certain issues and adjust demands on the infrastructure accordingly. Here, the tool therefore enables prevention through forwards planning.</p>

<h2>Increased Security as an Added Perk to Monitoring Your Network</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another essential aspect of network server monitoring is boosted security. With the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber threats, monitoring server logs, network traffic and system behaviour is crucial. They indeed help detect any unauthorised access attempts, unusual activities or potential security breaches.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By analysing the collected data, administrators can identify security vulnerabilities, implement appropriate security measures and enhance the overall server security posture. All this contributes to maintain the stability and efficiency of your business’ IT infrastructure.</p>

<h2>A quick aside About Simple Network Management Protocol</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely adopted network management standard. It allows administrators to monitor and manage network devices, including servers. Therefore, it is most often a central process in today’s topic. SNMP operates on a client-server model. In such a model, SNMP agents are installed on managed devices, then a central SNMP manager collects and analyses data from these agents.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The structure used by the protocol to organise and represent data is called the Management Information Base (MIB). This contains data such as system performance metrics, network statistics and device configurations. By leveraging SNMP, administrators can proactively monitor server health, track performance metrics and receive notifications in case of any anomalies or critical events. <a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/server-monitoring/">With TSplus, much of this is made simple.</a> Read on for more detail.</p>

<h2>Areas of Network Server Monitoring:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Crucial to businesses, server monitoring ensures the availability, reliability and security of their network servers. Here are some key aspects of effective server monitoring:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Performance Monitoring:</strong> Server monitoring tools enable the tracking of vital performance metrics like CPU usage, memory utilisation, disk space, network traffic. By monitoring these metrics, administrators can identify bottlenecks, forecast resource requirements and optimise server performance.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fault Detection:</strong> Real-time monitoring helps detect server faults, such as service failures, hardware issues and connectivity problems. Immediate notification and alerting mechanisms enable IT teams to quickly respond to critical events, reducing downtime. This, in turn, mitigates potential business impacts.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Capacity Planning:</strong> Server monitoring allows administrators to gather historical data on resource usage patterns, enabling effective capacity planning. Therefore, you can analyse trends and make a projection of future demands. This allows businesses to proactively allocate resources, scale infrastructure and avoid performance degradation due to capacity limitations.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Security Monitoring:</strong> Server monitoring tools can also assist in identifying security threats and vulnerabilities. Hence why monitoring log files, network traffic and system behaviour is paramount. Thus, administrators can detect suspicious activities, unauthorised access attempts or potential breaches, consequently enhancing overall server security.</p>

<h2>Simplify Commands with TSplus Remote Support</h2>
Remote Desktop is an invaluable tool for accessing and managing computers remotely. One action that remote desktop use will entail is being able to send command lines. For instance, many agents need to send the Ctrl+Alt+Del command to a remote desktop. Indeed, this specific keystroke combination typically triggers the local machine's security options.

In this article, we will explore various methods for how to send Ctrl+Alt+Del to remote desktop sessions. With this in mind, we will also see how <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> is a simple and reliable solution to seamlessly send commands and for all your remote management.
<h2>Understanding the Ctrl+Alt+Del Challenge</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">On Windows systems, Ctrl+Alt+Del is a key combination that is critical for security purposes. When pressed together on the local machine, these three keys open the Security Options screen. This menu in turn allows users to lock their computer, switch users or access the Task Manager. However, when working with a remote desktop session, sending Ctrl+Alt+Del can pose a challenge due to the interaction between the local and remote machines. It quite simply opens the menu options or Task Manager of the local machine. Yet, here, our aim is to access the remote menu or Task Manager.</p>

<h2>Method 1 – Ctrl+Alt+End on an On-Screen Keyboard:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The on-screen keyboard approach, a popular method, is to use the On-Screen Keyboard of the remote device. Of course you have to previously enable remote connections and create a remote user.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you have opened the remote session, the utility for this method can be accessed by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Open the Start menu of the remote session and navigate to the "Accessories" folder.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Click on "Ease of Access" and select "On-Screen Keyboard." (You may also like to search for OSK in the menu-bar. This should yield the same result.)</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once the On-Screen Keyboard appears, click the Ctrl, Alt, and Del keys in sequence to send the command to the remote desktop session.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">NB: If you have trouble opening the start menu due to mouse interference, command Alt+Home should open it anyhow.</p>

<h2>Method 2 – Ctrl+Alt+End on a Hardware Keyboard:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Ctrl+Alt+End shortcut is another method. It consists in using the Ctrl+Alt+End key- combination instead. This emulates the “Ctrl+Alt+Del” command within a remote desktop session.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note there is another possibility within this method if you have a part-size keyboard or small laptop (There, End is not on the right-hand 1 key since the number-pad is absent. It is often by the arrows in that case.). It is to use the Fn key in combination with Del. This two-key pair generally still sends the “Ctrl+Alt+Del” command to remote Terminal Servers.
Follow these steps once you have set- up a remote connection and that the remote session is active:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ensure your active window is the open remote device session (for example by clicking on the remote desktop screen).</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Press Ctrl+Alt+End simultaneously to send the “Ctrl+Alt+Del” command to the remote session.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Method 3:
Utilising the TSplus Remote Support Solution</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> is an affordable remote access and support solution that simplifies remote management tasks. With TSplus, sending Ctrl+Alt+Del to a remote desktop session becomes effortless. Here's how:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As above, steps a. and b. are prior steps. They aim to open the remote session and make sure that you are in the corresponding window.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">a. Install and configure TSplus Remote Support on the agent machine.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">b. Establish a connection between the local agent device and the remote machine by using the TSplus Remote Support software. The remote user will have credentials to give the agent in order to authorise the connection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">NB: Connections can be attended, as with previous methods. More importantly, they can also be unattended. This gives agents a newfound freedom to work at truly any time.</p>

<h4>Now for method 3:</h4>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once connected, navigate to the "Commands" tab in the TSplus Remote Support interface.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Locate the "Ctrl+Alt+Del" command button and click on it to send the keystroke combination directly to the remote desktop session.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>To Conclude on How to Send Ctrl+Alt+Del to Remote Desktop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sending Ctrl+Alt+Del to a remote desktop session is essential for accessing security options and performing various administrative tasks. While traditional methods do work, they often involve several steps. This makes them less efficient solutions than TSplus Remote Support. Our software streamlines the process by providing a dedicated command for sending Ctrl+Alt+Del directly to the remote desktop session. By implementing TSplus Remote Support, remote management becomes more convenient, secure and user-friendly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whether you choose to use the On-Screen Keyboard, the Ctrl+Alt+End shortcut or <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support,</a> we hope these methods met your expectations. As we seek empower businesses to efficiently, seamlessly and securely carry out remote management, this is one simple step. Our goal for SMBs as well as corporate enterprises is enhanced productivity, easier organisation and growth.

Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) has long been a popular method for remotely accessing computers and servers. It allows users to connect to a remote desktop from anywhere in the world, providing a convenient and efficient way to work remotely. However, the security of RDP connections has regularly been a concern. This has historically lead organisations to seek secure alternatives or complements to prioritize data protection and confidentiality.

Read on for a secure alternative to Windows RDP. Indeed, in this article, we will explore the advantages and potential issues of Windows RDP. We will then introduce <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security </a>as a robust solution for enhancing the security of remote connections.
<h2>Understanding Windows RDP and Its Advantages:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Windows RDP is a built-in feature of the Windows operating system that enables users to access and control remote computers. It offers several advantages, including:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote Access: RDP allows users to access their desktops and applications remotely, providing flexibility and mobility. It enables remote workers to remain productive. Indeed, they can connect to their work environment from any location.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Collaborative Working: RDP facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple users to connect to the same remote desktop simultaneously. This feature is particularly useful for team projects and troubleshooting tasks.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cost-Effective: Since RDP is a built-in feature, there is no need for additional software licenses or investments. Consequently, it is a cost-effective solution for remote access.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages and Security Issues of Windows RDP</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, in spite of its benefits, Windows RDP has been associated with security vulnerabilities that can expose organizations to various risks.
Potential Issues with Windows RDP:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Brute-Force Attacks: RDP has been a target for brute-force attacks, where hackers attempt to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying different username and password combinations.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Weak Authentication: RDP often relies on authentication methods such as single-factor username and password. Unfortunately, these leave potential inroads which mean RDP security can be easily compromised.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Exploitable Vulnerabilities: Windows RDP has been targeted by numerous exploits and vulnerabilities over the years, which have lead to unauthorized access, data breaches and system compromise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introducing TSplus Advanced Security as an Alternative for Secure Remote Connections</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nevertheless, the picture does not have to be that bleak. To address the security concerns associated with Windows RDP, TSplus offers an innovative solution: TSplus Advanced Security. This powerful tool enhances the security of remote connections, safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring a robust defence against cyber threats.</p>

<h2>Securing RDP Connectivity with TSplus Advanced Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security </a>incorporates several key features that mitigate the risks associated with traditional RDP. Here are a hand-picked few:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Brute-Force Attacks Protection: TSplus Advanced Security protects against brute-force attacks by monitoring and analysing login attempts in real-time. It can automatically blacklist IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behaviour, effectively blocking potential attackers.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ransomware and Malware Protection: The Advanced Security solution employs intelligent behavioural analysis to detect and prevent ransomware and malware attacks. It actively monitors system activity and can block suspicious processes. That is how it prevents unauthorized access and data loss.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Server Access Control: With TSplus Advanced Security, administrators have granular control over user access rights and permissions. They can define access policies based on user roles and implement restrictions. This, in turn, ensures that only authorized individuals can connect to sensitive resources.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://tsplus.net/two-factor-authentication/">Two-Factor Authentication</a>: Advanced Security is part of our remote access and control software suite. As part of it, you can benefit from 2FA. By implementing two-factor authentication, TSplus adds an extra layer of security to RDP connections. Users are required to provide a second authentication factor in addition to their username and password. Examples of these: fingerprint, smart card, mobile app-generated code... This is an important extra step towards cyber-security.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion on Secure Alternative to Windows RDP</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">While Windows RDP has been a popular method for remote access, security concerns have prompted the search for more secure alternatives. TSplus Advanced Security offers a comprehensive solution that enhances the security of RDP connections. Protect your company devices and infrastructures from cyber threats. Ensure your business the confidentiality and integrity of its data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By implementing features such as brute-force protection and ransomware prevention, <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> provides peace of mind for businesses relying on remote connectivity. With TSplus Advanced Security, organisations can leverage the benefits of remote access while prioritizing the security of their systems and sensitive information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Time to go over basic security steps to take against these.</p>

<h2>Some Important Security Steps to Take When Connecting Remote Desktop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before diving into the specifics of securing your remote desktop connection, it is crucial to comprehend the potential risks involved. Some common vulnerabilities and threats associated with remote desktop connections are brute-force attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, password cracking and unauthorized access attempts. Time to go over basic security steps to take against these.</p>

<h2>1. Enforce Strong Authentication:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the fundamental steps in securing your remote desktop connection is implementing robust authentication mechanisms. This includes and, in fact, begins with, password-based authentication. There always reason for stressing this point.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yet, another great addition is two-factor authentication (2FA). Certificate-based authentication, which is an integral part of most remote software nowadays, also has an important place. These items all work as a team to ward off threats rather than one by one. Each is indeed essential to remote access and control taking place securely.</p>

<h2>2. Implement Network-Level Security:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your remote desktop traffic, implementing network-level security measures is crucial. Potential tools for this start with a sturdy network firewall. A virtual private network (VPN) is also a possibility. In cases where remote connections will be made from outside your closed network, it makes sense to consider network segmentation. Such measures will doubtless enhance the security of your remote desktop connections.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">We highly recommend you follow this up with a company policy encouraging the use of strong passwords. Something else to encourage is for users to regularly log out of their sessions. Simply bear in mind that insisting on doing so at too high a frequency would be burdensome for those constantly using remote sessions.</p>

<h2>4. Enable Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a widely used protocol Desktop Protocol (RDP) has been a historical target for attacks. Since it needs to be properly secured remember such techniques as enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), configuring encryption settings, and changing default RDP port numbers. These hide or obscure ports and provide extra gates to pass upon attempting to enter the perimeter of your network. Needless to say, they can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>5. Monitor and Audit Remote Access:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maintaining visibility into remote desktop connections is crucial for detecting and responding to security incidents promptly. Hence the importance of monitoring and auditing remote access activities. Some aspects to keep watch over are log files and user sessions. Close monitoring of these can help nip certain issues in the bud. Also, implementing intrusion detection systems can enable your teams to detect and halt an attack just about in real time.</p>

<h2>6. Deploy TSplus Advanced Security to Connect Remote Desktop:</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Advanced Security is a powerful solution designed to enhance the security of your remote desktop environment. It offers multiple layers of protection to prevent unauthorized access and fortify your system against a whole variety of types of attacks. You may be please to know that <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/features/">most of the above security measures are covered</a> by TSplus Advanced Security.</p>

Today's business landscape revolves around IT and all things digital, whether from near or far. Many businesses and organisations rely, sometimes entirely, on networked computer systems for efficient data management and seamless communication. Terminal servers play a crucial role in this context by enabling remote access and centralised control over applications and resources.

In this article, we will delve into the question: “what is a terminal server”. We will look at its functionality and the importance of securing servers in a networked environment. Additionally, we will rapidly explore <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> and other TSplus software solutions that contribute to building, managing and enhancing business networks.
<h2>Understanding TS: What are Terminal Servers?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A terminal server is a hardware or software-based solution that facilitates remote access to applications and data stored on a centralised server. What Microsoft first introduced as Terminal Services is now known as Remote Desktop Services. In practice, it acts as an intermediary between end-user devices, such as computers, laptops or thin clients, and the actual server infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Terminal servers enable multiple users to simultaneously access the same server, creating a cost-effective and scalable solution for businesses. Indeed, instead of installing applications on each individual devices, users connect to the terminal server and access their desktop environments, files and software remotely, including any applications. This centralisation simplifies management, enhances data security and streamlines software updates and maintenance.</p>

<h2>Benefits and Use Cases of a Terminal Server</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Terminal servers offer numerous benefits to businesses of all sizes across various industries. Here are some key advantages:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> By using a terminal server, businesses can extend the lifespan of their existing hardware. Indeed, processing power is concentrated in the server infrastructure. Therefore, this divides the number of device upgrades and significantly lowers maintenance costs.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Terminal servers centralise data storage and application access, allowing for robust security measures to be implemented on the server level. Users can access sensitive information remotely without the risk of data loss or theft. This is an essential in the event of a device being lost or compromised.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Improved Collaboration:</strong> Terminal servers enable multiple users to work simultaneously on the same applications and files, fostering collaboration and boosting productivity. Teams can pool information, work on projects together, easily exchanging data.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Remote Access:</strong> Terminal servers enable employees to access their work environments and applications from any location, provided they have an internet connection. This flexibility promotes remote work, enhances mobility, and ensures business continuity during unforeseen circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Practical Aspects of Terminal Server Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now we have looked at what a terminal server is and seen some use cases, it is time to see some questions raised in their wake. These are mainly due to device and Internet related aspects of terminal servers and their nature. The physical machine amounts to a box which non-technicians might say resembles a router. It presents many sockets. Where wires plug in, so lines lead in and out of the box. What this entails is in fact a considerable security issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This concept of “line in-line out” would provide a field-day for hackers and other cyber-threats. Hence an important matter: a terminal server used to be quite simple for LAN purposes but needs to be secure and protected if it is to be part of a network. This is true even if only a part of the network will face Internet, its possibilities and its dangers.</p>

<h2>Securing Networked Servers with TSplus Advanced Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to networked servers with internet access, robust security measures are thus paramount. This is necessary to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorised access. TSplus Advanced Security provides a comprehensive solution to safeguard servers from external threats. Its key features include:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Intrusion Detection System (IDS):</strong> TSplus Advanced Security acts as an intrusion detector. Indeed, it monitors network traffic and detects suspicious activities or intrusion attempts in real-time, it watches processes and blocks dangerous IPs, and more. This proactive approach enables prompt responses and minimises the risk of security breaches.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Two-factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Implementing 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two forms of identification, such as a password and a unique code sent to their mobile device. This mitigates the risk of unauthorised access even if passwords were compromised.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="https://docs.dl-files.com/advanced-security/advanced-bruteforce">Brute-Force Attack Protection:</a></strong> TSplus Advanced Security protects against brute-force attacks by automatically blocking IP addresses that exhibit suspicious login behaviour. This prevents hackers from repeatedly attempting to gain access through the server's login interface.</p>
</li>
</ol>

This mitigates the risk of unauthorised access even if passwords were compromised.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.dl-files.com\/advanced-security\/advanced-bruteforce\">Brute-Force Attack Protection:<\/a><\/strong> TSplus Advanced Security protects against brute-force attacks by automatically blocking IP addresses that exhibit suspicious login behaviour. This prevents hackers from repeatedly attempting to gain access through the server's login interface.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Additional TSplus Software Solutions<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to TSplus Advanced Security, <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/\">TSplus offers a range of software solutions<\/a> for efficient remote support, simple affordable application publishing and enhanced server monitoring.

Chrome Remote Desktop is a free tool that allows users to access their computers remotely, providing convenience and flexibility. In this article, we will guide you through the step-by-step process of using Chrome Remote Desktop. Additionally, we will explore the benefits of free remote desktop access. Then we can discuss the reasons why investing in a versatile, reliable, secure and affordable solution like <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus Remote Access</a> might be the right choice for your needs.
<h2>How to Use Chrome Remote Desktop?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Setting up:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Install Chrome Remote Desktop Extension</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Open the Chrome web browser and navigate to the Chrome Web Store.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Search for "Chrome Remote Desktop" and click on the "Add to Chrome" button to install the extension.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Set Up Remote Access on the Host Computer</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Launch the Chrome Remote Desktop app from the Chrome App Launcher.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Click on the "Get Started" button in the "My Computers" section.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Under the "Remote Assistance" section, click on the "Enable remote connections" button.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Set a PIN for secure access and click on the "OK" button.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Validate Your Access the Host Computer</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the device from which you want to access the host computer, open the Chrome browser and visit the Chrome Remote Desktop website.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Click on the "Access" button next to the computer you want to connect to.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enter the PIN you set earlier and click on the "Connect" button.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">The remote connection should now be established, so you can control the host computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enjoy the capacities offered by Chrome Remote Desktop to access files remotely, open applications on your remote computer and remotely control it. When you have finished, closing the window will end the connection and therefore the session.</p>

<h2>Chrome Remote Desktop In Use</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Controlling your remote host is then very much like controlling any computer. Your mouse and keyboard will prompt it and more options are available. Clipboard synchronisation, file transfer, and a variety of display modes are readily available. You also have access to a brief menu with some basic command prompts that come in useful when remotely controlling other machines.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Free Remote Desktop Access Software</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Convenience</strong>:
Access your computer from anywhere, anytime, using any device with an internet connection. Nothing more than your favourite browser is needed.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Cost Savings</strong>:
Free remote desktop access eliminates the need for expensive hardware or software solutions. Ideal when on a tight budget or for simple one-off requirements.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Simplified Collaboration</strong>:
Easily share your screen and collaborate with colleagues or provide remote support to friends and family. Suited for users who do not have a professional need for such tools.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Accessibility</strong>:
Retrieve files, documents and applications stored on your computer, even when you're away. As easily available as any other online resource you may use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Free But Basic Remote Access</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Even though Chrome Remote Desktop is a non-negligeable tool, it nonetheless remains a free tool, and one that is not exhaustive. For full capacity remote software, with a wide range of features, you will most likely look at paid products.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, Chrome’s solution lacks various sets of actions and possibilities essential to remote working, application publication and distant desktop access. And what of the power and scalability offered by the likes of our TSplus Remote Access? These are just scratching the surface of what potential many licenced products will offer clients. So, read on, for a more versatile yet quite affordable working toolbox.</p>

<h2>Reasons to Invest in a Licensed Software Tool</h2>

<h2>III. Scope of Use for Remote Desktop Connection in Business</h2>

When initially connecting, they can connect in one of the following modes:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>• "Remote Control"</strong> allows support agents to assume control of the remote session using their mouse and keyboard, while simultaneously viewing the screen of the distant session.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>• "Command Line"</strong> permits the display of a command prompt within the context of the remote session. However, it is important to note that the "Command Line" mode is only accessible if unattended access is enabled on the remote computer.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Manage Computers:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">As an agent, you can save computers, whether they have granted unattended access or are available only for attended sessions. You can add computers, remove them, manage then including share any with a colleague. Additionally, there is space to take notes about each and the lists are also searchable.</p>

<h2>The Latest Remote Desktop Client for Windows 10</h2>
With the ever-increasing demand for remote access and virtualization services, the latest Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client for Windows 10 is a crucial tool. Indeed, many businesses and individuals still use Windows 10 and some are even running Windows 7. All these need remote access to their data and apps just as do companies that have renewed their infrastructure.
In this article, we will explore the question “what is the latest RDP client for windows 10?”. We will also go over principal features and capabilities.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's New in the Remote Desktop Client for Windows 10 and Remote Desktop Services</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is worth remembering that different clients may support more or less features. We recommend users check this according to what their system supports. Azure is supported by most and offers a comprehensive experience. As of the latest update, early August 2023, the Remote Desktop client for Windows has reached version 1.2.4487, with both public and Insider releases.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These versions are available for Windows 64-bit, Windows 32-bit and Windows ARM64. The updates include bug fixes, performance enhancements and new features aimed at providing a smoother and more secure remote desktop experience. With Azure central to these steps forwards, businesses worldwide are faced with a choice between a rapidly expensive Microsoft path or the search for an alternative.</p>

<h2>TSplus Remote Access: A Powerful Complement to RDP for Windows 7 and Windows 10</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">For a simpler and affordable experience, on the other hand, we highly recommend you see what <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> has to offer. It has powerful application publishing capacities and will web-enable any legacy apps.</p>

<h2>Quick Summary of Steps to Delete Local TeamViewer App and Data</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are in a rush to proceed with deleting data from your machine, but not actually after deleting you account as such, then this is for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bear in mind, this affects only what is saved on your current device, which means you may have other machines holding this information. And more importantly, your account will not be deleted by this action, only the locally held application and data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In short, you need to perform the following steps.</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Navigate to c:program files (x86)teamviewer in the File Explorer.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look for uninstall.exe and run it to uninstall the TeamViewer software.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Disable any TeamViewer services found in the Services panel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step-by-Step Guides for Deleting TeamViewer Accounts:</h2>
<h3>1. TeamViewer (Classic) Account Deletion:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">To delete your TeamViewer (Classic) account, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sign-in to your TeamViewer account.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Click on your username located in the top-right corner and select "Edit profile."</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Locate the "Delete account" button in the upper right corner and click it.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Confirm the deletion by selecting "Yes."</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">NB: Remember that once the account is deleted, all data, including owned groups, computers, and contacts, will be permanently removed.</p>

<h3>2. Deleting a TeamViewer Account from within a Company Account:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before performing the above steps, you will need to contact the administrator who may proceed with the deletion of your company related profile and your individual account. The administrator may also delete only your profile and company accesses from within the company account, then leave you to carry out the above account deletion steps for your personal account.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Technically, in Europe, you are more likely to experience this second event, since Data Protection Law will require you to delete your own account yourself rather than allow the company IT personnel to do so. Other regions may differ.</p>

<h3>3. Deletion of a TeamViewer Remote Account:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">To delete your TeamViewer Remote account, perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sign-in to your account through the TeamViewer Remote client or visit https://web.teamviewer.com/.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Click on the cog-wheel (Settings) located on the lower-left corner.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Select "Go to your profile's settings."</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Click on "Delete" under the "Delete account" line on the right-hand side.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Confirm the deletion by clicking "Delete."</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">NB: As for other account types, the deletion will remove all data associated with the account, such as groups, computers and contacts.</p>

<h3>4. TeamViewer Account Deletion via Email:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Users have the option to delete their account by sending an email to privacy@teamviewer.com. Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Open your registered email account associated with TeamViewer.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Compose an email addressed to privacy@teamviewer.com.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Use "Request to delete my account" as the subject line.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Write an email requesting the removal of your account and all associated information from their database. Then send.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>5. How to Delete your TeamViewer Account via the Website:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">To delete your account through the TeamViewer website, follow these instructions:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Go to the official TeamViewer website.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Log in to your account using your credentials.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Click on your profile name located at the top-right corner of the page.</p>

</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">A pop-up will appear, asking for confirmation to delete your account. Click "Yes" to proceed with the deletion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>TeamViewer Account Deletion Complete</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whatever type of account you had, that’s it for the steps to delete your TeamViewer account and ensuring that your data is permanently removed from the system.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remember that account deletion is irreversible and will remove all owned groups, computers, and contacts. Choose the appropriate method based on your account type and practicalities, then follow the steps carefully to complete the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Incidentally, since you have chosen to delete your TeamViewer account, you may be please to read our <a href="https://tsplus.net/top-alternatives-to-teamviewer-for-remote-support/">TeamViewer Alternatives</a> article to see some of the other software available.</p>

<h2>TeamViewer Accounts Management for Businesses</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Businesses using TeamViewer may encounter the need to delete accounts belonging to former staff members from their company's TeamViewer. However, based on several posts on the TeamViewer community forum, the platform's account deletion process falls short in providing a bulk solution to this task.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Are you interested in a simple and affordable yet secure and powerful solution to use instead of TeamViewer? Then our own <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> software could be just what you have been looking for.</p>

<h2>Agents, Groups and Data Management With TSplus Remote Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">By default, sessions are not shared, but an agent can invite one or more others, on a case by case basis, great for team work and more. Our software being self-hosted in dedicated servers, connexions are rapid and interventions fluid. Then, as all logs are locally held, TSplus has access to no client data whatsoever. Finally, beyond the Agent Accounts tab, the administrator also has direct access to licence related aspects directly within the TSplus licencing portal.</p>

<h2>General Account Management and Related Issues in Company Accounts</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In any accounts management scenario, not being unable to completely remove deleted users is likely to lead to those users remaining assigned to closed and expired cases in a company’s service queue. This inability to unassign users presents a potential challenge when the account owner is no longer accessible, as in the case of old staff members.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a consequence, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance questions will arise since, so long as the individual does not delete the account themselves, the company will be left with this open-ended situation.</p>

<h2>Planning for Appropriate Data and Accounts Management</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This leaves a joint responsibility with businesses and employees: to collaborate in going through all the steps required to preserve personal and company data and accesses from being left available to potential issues such as cyber-attacks. And with any company lies the responsibility of closely examining available options when choosing software, services and any other suppliers or products.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is worth finding out in advance how data and account information will be processed, held, deleted, etc. It may sway your decisions towards one or another solution.</p>

<h2>More About TSplus Remote Support as an Alternative to TeamViewer</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Providing relief from the above issues, TSplus Remote Support offers a simple user-management solution. It streamlines the process of managing support agent accounts, making it easy for businesses to handle account deletions and prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As cloud-based support software goes, Remote Support is ideal for providing <a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/remote-support-v3/unattended">attended/unattended assistance</a> to remote clients. The TSplus suite, additionally includes Remote Access, Advanced Security and Server Monitoring. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for businesses seeking reliable and user-friendly remote solutions.</p>

<h2>Company Colours Remote Support, Embedding and Other Options</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is easy to configure the dashboard of TSplus Remote Support so that it displays your company logo and arbours your colours. These settings are only saved when you have an active licence, so be sure to subscribe at the end of your 15 day free trial.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The same goes for computer lists and logs, and for settings such as WoL. The latest feature added by our teams on the suggestion of one of our TSplus resellers is the capacity to capture UAC screens.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And if you need one final reason to save your settings, you gain the ability to embed your customised version of our software in your website. That way, your customer can click and share their screen with your agents instantly.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In conclusion, deleting personal TeamViewer accounts should offer no issues. Potentially though, we have seen that administrators in larger companies may face challenges with account deletions in TeamViewer business accounts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyhow, I invite each reader to test and find out for yourselves how <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> can be a superior alternative to TeamViewer, especially for simplicity and price.

Then our own <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-support\/\">TSplus Remote Support<\/a> software could be just what you have been looking for.<\/p>","align":"justify","__globals__":{"text_color":"globals\/colors?id=secondary"},"custom_css":"h2 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: #F99106;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n}"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"78e919f","elType":"widget","settings":{"image":{"url":"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/TSplus-Remote-Support-architecture.png","id":33820,"size":"","alt":"Image depicting the main parts of the TSplus Remote Support architecture.","source":"library"},"link_to":"custom","link":{"url":"https:\/\/docs.terminalserviceplus.com\/remote-support-v3\/","is_external":"","nofollow":"","custom_attributes":""}},"elements":[],"widgetType":"image"},{"id":"ae48c1f","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>Agents, Groups and Data Management With TSplus Remote Support<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">By default, sessions are not shared, but an agent can invite one or more others, on a case by case basis, great for team work and more. Our software being self-hosted in dedicated servers, connexions are rapid and interventions fluid. Then, as all logs are locally held, TSplus has access to no client data whatsoever. Finally, beyond the Agent Accounts tab, the administrator also has direct access to licence related aspects directly within the TSplus licencing portal.<\/p><h2>General Account Management and Related Issues in Company Accounts<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In any accounts management scenario, not being unable to completely remove deleted users is likely to lead to those users remaining assigned to closed and expired cases in a company\u2019s service queue. This inability to unassign users presents a potential challenge when the account owner is no longer accessible, as in the case of old staff members.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As a consequence, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance questions will arise since, so long as the individual does not delete the account themselves, the company will be left with this open-ended situation.<\/p><h2>Planning for Appropriate Data and Accounts Management<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This leaves a joint responsibility with businesses and employees: to collaborate in going through all the steps required to preserve personal and company data and accesses from being left available to potential issues such as cyber-attacks. And with any company lies the responsibility of closely examining available options when choosing software, services and any other suppliers or products.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is worth finding out in advance how data and account information will be processed, held, deleted, etc. It may sway your decisions towards one or another solution.<\/p><h2>More About TSplus Remote Support as an Alternative to TeamViewer<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Providing relief from the above issues, TSplus Remote Support offers a simple user-management solution. It streamlines the process of managing support agent accounts, making it easy for businesses to handle account deletions and prevent unauthorised access.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As cloud-based support software goes, Remote Support is ideal for providing <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.terminalserviceplus.com\/remote-support-v3\/unattended\">attended\/unattended assistance<\/a> to remote clients. The TSplus suite, additionally includes Remote Access, Advanced Security and Server Monitoring. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for businesses seeking reliable and user-friendly remote solutions.<\/p><h2>Company Colours Remote Support, Embedding and Other Options<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is easy to configure the dashboard of TSplus Remote Support so that it displays your company logo and arbours your colours. These settings are only saved when you have an active licence, so be sure to subscribe at the end of your 15 day free trial.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The same goes for computer lists and logs, and for settings such as WoL. The latest feature added by our teams on the suggestion of one of our TSplus resellers is the capacity to capture UAC screens.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And if you need one final reason to save your settings, you gain the ability to embed your customised version of our software in your website. That way, your customer can click and share their screen with your agents instantly.<\/p><h2>Conclusion on How to Delete Your TeamViewer Account<\/h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In conclusion, deleting personal TeamViewer accounts should offer no issues. Potentially though, we have seen that administrators in larger companies may face challenges with account deletions in TeamViewer business accounts.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Anyhow, I invite each reader to test and find out for yourselves how <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-support\/\">TSplus Remote Support<\/a> can be a superior alternative to TeamViewer, especially for simplicity and price.

<h2>TSplus Advanced Security: Safeguarding Your IT Infrastructure</h2>
In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity is paramount for IT professionals and companies seeking to protect their networks from the ever-evolving threats of cybercrime. TSplus Advanced Security offers a comprehensive solution to fortify your defences and ensure the safety of your systems. In this article, we'll explore two key features that make our software an indispensable tool for safeguarding your IT infrastructure. Delve with me into Hacker IP Protection and Global IP Management with <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a>.
<h2>Hacker IP Protection: Crowd-Sourced Security by TSplus</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hacker IP Protection is your shield against known threats. These include online attacks, service abuse, malware, botnets and other cybercrimes. This feature harnesses the collective knowledge of the Advanced Security community to automatically blacklist over 368 million identified threats upon implementation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From then on, it is updated daily, as the event will tell you within your Advanced Security Window mentioning “Synchronised Hacker IP addresses…”. This event takes place upon activation of the software. You can also click the “Refresh Hacker IP” button to synchronise manually whenever you see fit.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Block Malicious IP Addresses:</strong> Keep your system protected by automatically blocking recognised threats, bolstering your defences against cyberattacks.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Community-Powered Security:</strong> Hacker IP Protection relies on the vigilance of the Advanced Security user community to ensure that all blacklisted IPs are genuine threats, minimising false positives.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Automated Updates:</strong> The feature updates daily, providing you with real-time protection against emerging threats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Guide to Hacker IP Protection with TSplus Advanced Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To harness the power of <a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/advanced-security/hacker-ip">Hacker IP Protection</a> and never miss an update:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Subscription Required:</strong> Ensure you have an active Support and Updates Services subscription to access this feature.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Automatic Updates:</strong> Hacker IP Protection updates automatically every day, keeping your system and data safe from the latest threats.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Manual Update:</strong> If need be, you can manually update from the "Blocked IP Addresses" tab by clicking the "Refresh Hacker IP" button./p&gt;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Global IP Management: Advanced Security Simplifies Access Control</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Managing IP addresses effectively is at the core of network security. TSplus Advanced Security's Global IP Management feature streamlines this process, offering a unified allow/block list that simplifies access control.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Easy Management:</strong> With TSplus Advanced Security, you can effortlessly manage both blocked and whitelisted IP addresses using only one list. This single list centralises everything to simplify the task of keeping your network secure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Search Bar:</strong> The built-in search bar allows you to conveniently locate and manage IP addresses. For instance, if you were looking for blocked addresses, for instance, you would simply enter "blocked" in the search bar. All blocked IPs would then be displayed by the filter.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>IP Address Description:</strong> Assign meaningful descriptions to IP addresses to identify them quickly in the future. Thus-naming important addresses makes it easier to keep track of your access list.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Multi-address Editing:</strong> TSplus Advanced Security enables you to add multiple blocked IP addresses to your whitelist with a single action, enhancing efficiency in access management. To do this, use the “add existing to whitelist” tab.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is worth noting that, by default, server localhosts addresses are whitelisted, as are IPV4 and IPV6.</p>

<h2>Implementation Guide for Global IP Management with TSplus</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One way to make the most of Global IP Management is using command line.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Whitelist IPs:</strong> With command line it is straightforward to whitelist one IP address as well as to whitelist all the addresses within a given range. Here is the syntax to follow:</p>

<pre style="text-align: left;">TSplus-Security.exe addwhitelistedip [ip addresses] [optional description]</pre>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Multiple IPs and IP Ranges:</strong> If you wish to specify multiple IP addresses, IP address ranges or even add descriptions for each rule, you simply use colon or semi-colon to separate the values Here is an example:</p>

<pre style="text-align: left;">TSplus-Security.exe addwhitelistedip 1.1.1.1;2.2.2.2;3.3.3.1-3.3.6.12;5.5.5.5 "John's workplaces"</pre>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you see, the syntax is x.x.x.x-y.y.y.y delimitated by a semi-colon.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Block IPs:</strong> Blocking IP Addresses is a similar process. To blocking IP addresses, the command follows the syntax:</p>

<pre style="text-align: left;">TSplus-Security.exe blockips [ip addresses] [optional description]</pre>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Unblock IPs:</strong> Unblocking IP Addresses, once more, uses similar syntax, whether for one or more IP addresses. Follow this example:</p>

<pre style="text-align: left;">TSplus-Security.exe unblockips [ip addresses]</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note that this command won't affect IP addresses blocked by Hacker IP Protection. Unblocking one of the addresses pre-blocked by Hacker IP Protection requires actually whitelisting it.</p>

<h2>As a Conclusion on TSplus Advanced Security - Providing Top-Notch Cyber Protection from Malicious IPs</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you see, TSplus Advanced Security equips IT professionals and organisations with the tools needed to fortify their networks against cyber threats. Global IP Management simplifies access control, while Hacker IP Protection harnesses the collective knowledge of the community to guard against known threats.

		Long gone are the days when the first underwater cables were laid on the ocean floor to carry telegraph signals across. Landline telephones seem outdated apart for electricity-free communication. Voice and video communications use the Internet, and so does work and social life. However, one common frustration users face is the lengthy time it takes to establish certain remote sessions.
In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this issue of RDP, configuring remote session takes a long time. Join me in looking at potential solutions to stream-line the remote session configuration process. Additionally, explore <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> as a simple, versatile and secure product that can greatly enhance your remote experience and that of your clients.<h2>RDP - Why Configuring a Remote Session Takes a Long Time</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">When setting up an RDP session, the configuration process involves several steps that can consume valuable time. These steps often include establishing a connection, authenticating the user, establishing network settings, and configuring display options. The varying complexity of these steps, along with potential network or hardware limitations, can contribute to significant delays in session setup.</p>
<h2>Factors Affecting RDP Session Configuration Time:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Network Latency: Slow network connections or high latency can substantially impact the time required for RDP session configuration. The delay in data transmission between the client and the remote server can result in sluggish responsiveness and a prolonged setup process.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Authentication and Security Protocols: RDP relies on robust security measures to protect sensitive data during remote sessions. However, these security protocols, such as SSL encryption, can introduce additional overhead and increase the time required for authentication and establishing a secure connection.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hardware Limitations: The performance of the client and remote server hardware also plays a significant role in RDP configuration time. Insufficient processing power, limited memory or outdated network infrastructure can contribute to delays and sluggishness.</p>
</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Remote desktop connections are a valuable tool for IT professionals and businesses. They allow secure access to computers and servers from remote locations. This can serve companies in a whole range of situations, including what we have as today’s focus: remote support and screen control tasks.

Before remote access recently became a basic necessity, one of the initial reasons using RDP became common was for screen control and remote support. First, here's a step-by-step guide on how to allow remote desktop connection. Once you have enabled this feature native to Windows-based systems, next, you can choose to leverage <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a> so that those remote connections can be the lifeline of the host computers you will access.
<h2>Allowing Remote Desktop Connections</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Ensure Remote Desktop is Enabled:</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Open System Properties</strong>: Right-click "This PC" (or "My Computer" in older Windows versions). Then, select "Properties."</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Access Remote Settings</strong>: In the System window, in the left-hand menu, click on "Remote settings". You need administrative privileges for this step.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Enable Remote Desktop</strong>: In the Remote tab of the System Properties window, check the box labelled "Allow remote connections to this computer."</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>NB</strong>: You may select the option to allow connections from any version of Remote Desktop, or you can choose to allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication (more secure).</p>

<h3>Step 2: Configure Firewall and Network Settings</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Adjust Firewall Settings</strong>: Make sure your firewall isn't blocking Remote Desktop. You may need to add an exception for "Remote Desktop" or "mstsc.exe" (the Remote Desktop client).</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Check Network Connectivity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">: Ensure that your computer is connected to the network or the internet, as remote connections require a network connection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 3: Grant User Access</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Select Users</strong>: To allow specific users to connect remotely, click the "Select Users" button in the Remote tab.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Add Users</strong>: In the Remote Desktop Users window, click "Add" and enter the names of the users who should have remote access. Click "OK" when finished.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 4: Connect Remotely to Remote Desktops</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Find Your Computer's IP Address</strong>: You'll need your computer's IP address to connect remotely. One way you can find it is by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu, opening Command Prompt and typing "ipconfig".</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Remote Desktop Connection</strong>: On the remote computer, open the Remote Desktop client (usually "mstsc.exe").</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Enter IP Address</strong>: In the Remote Desktop client, enter the IP address or hostname of the computer to which you want to connect.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Login</strong>: You'll be prompted to enter the username and password of the remote computer. Once entered, click "Connect".</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Enjoy Remote Access</strong>: You should now be connected to the remote computer's desktop.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 5: Now You have Allowed Remote Desktop Connection, Secure Your Connection</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Use Strong Passwords</strong>: Ensure that both the local and remote computers have strong, unique passwords.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Enable Network Level Authentication (NLA)</strong>: If possible, enable NLA for an extra layer of security.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Remember to follow best practice</strong> for security, such as keeping your operating system and software updated. You can also consider using other security measures if necessary, such as a VPN, or, even better, TSplus Advanced Security.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: left;">Following these steps will allow remote desktop connections to your Windows computer or server, enabling efficient IT management and support, just as <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus offers a simplified and secure alternative for remote access and control</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Step 1</strong>: Access TSplus Remote Support, With or Without an Account!</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Choose:</strong> The first thing to do is to choose between expert or lite download. Are you an agent? Expert. Are you a general user requiring support? Lite.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Download:</strong> Download and install our software. From our website, this is done in a few clicks. The download should be rapid too since TSplus Remote Support is relatively light.</p>

As an agent with an account, log in to TSplus Remote Support using your credentials.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Dashboard:</strong> Once all set, you will be greeted by our user-friendly administration console, which is the central hub for all your remote support activities.</p>

<h3><strong>Step 2</strong>: Initiating Remote Assistance: Host or Agent Invites</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Invite the Agent:</strong> As a host, you can invite an agent to assist your device remotely in one click on your console. They will then need your ID and the onetime password that appears on your screen.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Launch a Support Session for a Saved Computer:</strong> To assist a remote client, agents can also initiate a support session. You can do this from the TSplus Remote Support dashboard, in the tab entitled “computers”. <a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/remote-support-v3/admin-console">To save devices, remember you need to register and log in</a>.</p>
</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see, for agents and hosts alike, TSplus provides easy ways to invite the other party to invite others and to launch or to join a session.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>NB:</strong> Unattended support can be enabled per device, as well as Wake-on-LAN.</p>

They allow secure access to computers and servers from remote locations. This can serve companies in a whole range of situations, including what we have as today\u2019s focus: remote support and screen control tasks.<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Before remote access recently became a basic necessity, one of the initial reasons using RDP became common was for screen control and remote support. First, here's a step-by-step guide on how to allow remote desktop connection. Once you have enabled this feature native to Windows-based systems, next, you can choose to leverage <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/remote-support\/\">TSplus Remote Support<\/a> so that those remote connections can be the lifeline of the host computers you will access.<\/p>","align":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Roboto","typography_font_weight":"400"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"a9924d3","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<h2>Allowing Remote Desktop Connections<\/h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Ensure Remote Desktop is Enabled:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Open System Properties<\/strong>: Right-click \"This PC\" (or \"My Computer\" in older Windows versions). Then, select \"Properties.\"<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Access Remote Settings<\/strong>: In the System window, in the left-hand menu, click on \"Remote settings\". You need administrative privileges for this step.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Enable Remote Desktop<\/strong>: In the Remote tab of the System Properties window, check the box labelled \"Allow remote connections to this computer.\"<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>NB<\/strong>: You may select the option to allow connections from any version of Remote Desktop, or you can choose to allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication (more secure).<\/p>\n\n<h3>Step 2: Configure Firewall and Network Settings<\/h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Adjust Firewall Settings<\/strong>: Make sure your firewall isn't blocking Remote Desktop. You may need to add an exception for \"Remote Desktop\" or \"mstsc.exe\" (the Remote Desktop client).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Check Network Connectivity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">: Ensure that your computer is connected to the network or the internet, as remote connections require a network connection.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Step 3: Grant User Access<\/h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Select Users<\/strong>: To allow specific users to connect remotely, click the \"Select Users\" button in the Remote tab.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Add Users<\/strong>: In the Remote Desktop Users window, click \"Add\" and enter the names of the users who should have remote access.

Remote access software allows users to access and control a computer or device from a different device in a different location. Remote access technology is commonly used for various purposes, such as providing technical support, collaborating on projects or accessing files and applications on a remote machine.

If your question is “how does remote access software work”, this article is the right read. We will take a look at that followed by some highlights of how our affordable <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> empowers your company to web-enable applications and provide remote desktops and environments, simply and securely.
<h2>Here is a general overview of how remote access software works:</h2>
<h3>1. Installation and Configuration:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Both the host (remote computer to be accessed) and the client (local computer initiating the remote access) need to have the remote access software installed which will use the native RDP. You can download software such from a provider's website (<a href="https://tsplus.net/download/">such as ours</a>) or install it through other methods (USB, etc.).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Establishing Remote Access Connexions:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">The client computer initiates a connexion request to the host computer. Therefore, this request usually involves inputting a unique identifier or IP address associated with the host machine.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Increasingly, you will establish secure connexions which use encryption protocols (such as SSL/TLS). This ensures the privacy and security of the data being transmitted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Authentication and Authorisation:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">The host computer's remote access software verifies the connexion request. This step often involves user authentication, where the client needs to provide valid credentials (username and password) or other forms of authentication (such as two-factor authentication) to gain access.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Authentication complete, the software determines the level of access of the user, which could range from viewing-only access to full control of the host machine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Data Transmission and Encryption:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Any data transmitted between the client and host computers, including screen images and input commands, is typically encrypted to ensure security and privacy. This prevents unauthorised interception and access.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. How to Terminate Remote Access Connexions:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, when the remote session is complete, the client can choose to disconnect from the host computer. Alternatively, the host user can also terminate the session.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Specifics of How Remote Access Software Works</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a few more specific aspects of the way remote access functions.</p>

<h3>"Replication" of the User Interface:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">The remote access software displays or in other words "replicates" the host computer's screen on the client device. This, hence, allows the remote user to see and control in real time exactly what is happening on the screen of the host machine.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Depending on the software, what is displayed might include the entire desktop with or without its file system, or one or more specific applications in their own floating windows, or whatever administrators parameter for the user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Input and Control:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">The client can interact with the host computer as with a local device. The remote access software sends the input commands through its interface. Inputs include actions such as clicking, typing, dragging and scrolling.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">The software then transmits these input commands to the host machine in real time. In turn, the host device processes them as though they were entered directly using the its physical keyboard, mouse or other.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Does Remote Access Software Work: An Important Security Note:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">While remote access software is incredibly useful, it also poses security risks. Unauthorised access to a computer can lead to data breaches and privacy violations. Therefore, it is essential to follow best practice guidelines, such as using strong passwords, making sure TLS/SSL type encryption are active and keeping software up to date.</p>

<h2>So, within that framework, how does TSplus Remote Access work?</h2>

Installation and Configuration:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Both the host (remote computer to be accessed) and the client (local computer initiating the remote access) need to have the remote access software installed which will use the native RDP. You can download software such from a provider's website (<a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/download\/\">such as ours<\/a>) or install it through other methods (USB, etc.).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Establishing Remote Access Connexions:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The client computer initiates a connexion request to the host computer. Therefore, this request usually involves inputting a unique identifier or IP address associated with the host machine.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Increasingly, you will establish secure connexions which use encryption protocols (such as SSL\/TLS). This ensures the privacy and security of the data being transmitted.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3. Authentication and Authorisation:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The host computer's remote access software verifies the connexion request. This step often involves user authentication, where the client needs to provide valid credentials (username and password) or other forms of authentication (such as two-factor authentication) to gain access.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Authentication complete, the software determines the level of access of the user, which could range from viewing-only access to full control of the host machine.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Data Transmission and Encryption:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Any data transmitted between the client and host computers, including screen images and input commands, is typically encrypted to ensure security and privacy. This prevents unauthorised interception and access.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>5. How to Terminate Remote Access Connexions:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, when the remote session is complete, the client can choose to disconnect from the host computer. Alternatively, the host user can also terminate the session.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Additional Specifics of How Remote Access Software Works<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here are a few more specific aspects of the way remote access functions.<\/p>\n\n<h3>\"Replication\" of the User Interface:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The remote access software displays or in other words \"replicates\" the host computer's screen on the client device. This, hence, allows the remote user to see and control in real time exactly what is happening on the screen of the host machine.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Depending on the software, what is displayed might include the entire desktop with or without its file system, or one or more specific applications in their own floating windows, or whatever administrators parameter for the user.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Input and Control:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The client can interact with the host computer as with a local device. The remote access software sends the input commands through its interface. Inputs include actions such as clicking, typing, dragging and scrolling.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The software then transmits these input commands to the host machine in real time. In turn, the host device processes them as though they were entered directly using the its physical keyboard, mouse or other.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How Does Remote Access Software Work: An Important Security Note:<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While remote access software is incredibly useful, it also poses security risks.

Remote desktop access is a powerful tool that allows users to connect to and control a computer or server from a different location over Internet. In this article, we'll explore how to set up remote desktop, both in a generic sense and with <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a>, a cost-effective alternative to Citrix and RDS. We'll also discuss some security issues associated with NLA and native RDP.
<h2>Understanding Remote Access Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Designed to enable users to access distant resources, remote access software facilitates connections between local and remote computers. To that purpose, RDP connects networks or devices from separate locations, making it a crucial tool for businesses and individuals alike.</p>

<h2>Prior to Setting Up Remote Desktop in Windows…</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To set up remote desktop in Windows, follow the steps appropriate to your operating system. Before you can enable remote desktop, ensure you have Windows Pro. To verify your edition, check under Windows specifications to see the Edition of your PC.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are using Windows Home, whether 11 or previous versions, you can upgrade to Windows 11 Pro for RDP features.</p>

<h2>How to Set Up Remote Desktop in Windows Operating Systems</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Chances are one of the three following sections have the steps you need to follow to proceed with enabling remote desktop:</p>

<h3>1. Setting Up Remote Desktop with Windows 11:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Select “Start” and open “Settings”.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Under “System”, locate and click on “Remote Desktop”.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Set the Remote Desktop slider to On and then confirm your choice.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Take note of the PC name listed under "PC name". You will need this information for the next steps.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Set up Remote Deskotp in Windows 10 (1709 or later):</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Go to “Start” and click on “Settings”.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Select “System”, then click on “Remote Desktop”.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Use the slider to enable Remote Desktop.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Add users who will be granted to connect remotely.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note the name of the PC for later use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. How to set up remote desktop in Windows 7 and Early Windows 10:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Download and run the Microsoft Remote Desktop Assistant.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Follow the instruction steps laid out above to enable remote access.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Again, keep a note of the PC’s name for later.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Issues with Native RDP</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Native RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) comes with security concerns. When you enable remote desktop, you open a port that can be visible to your local network. It is therefore crucial to restrict access to trusted networks only, as well as ensure strong passwords for all accounts with access.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, consider whether or not to enable Network Level Authentication (NLA). It adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to authenticate themselves before connecting and so helps protect against certain malicious attacks. But it also causes particular constraints which you may prefer to avoid.</p>

In IT management, remote monitoring tools have become indispensable assets for IT departments and managed service providers (MSPs). This means understanding and optimising your server and website performance is crucial. Infrastructure monitoring can give both overall and precise view of your servers, applications and internet-facing services, their usage and more.

Thus, such software enables proactive maintenance, prevention and troubleshooting of networks and IT assets, all from a centralised location. In this article, delve with me into the significance of remote server monitoring, its key features and hence some criteria for selecting the right server monitoring software. We will finish with by looking at what our very own <a href="https://tsplus.net/server-monitoring/">TSplus Server Monitoring</a> has to offer.
<h2>Why Remote Server Monitoring Matters</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As businesses expand, so do their resources, workforce and IT infrastructure. Therefore, the complexity of all these increases too, as well as their demands on each other and how they interact. With growth comes the need for a robust performance monitoring solution that can observe the health, activities and capability of servers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Server monitoring tools offer solutions in this context. Indeed, they step in to address a host of challenges faced by IT administrators. These can involve events and incidents such as server crashes, slow applications, unexpected downtime and thus the need to troubleshoot various issues.</p>

<h2>Sought-After Features of Remote Monitoring Software</h2>
<h3>1. Remote Server Monitoring Software - Did I Hear “Remote”?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Effective monitoring software should encompass a range of features that empower IT teams and MSPs to manage their networks and IT assets efficiently. One “feature” I am going to take for granted in this article is that of remote access. Indeed, the ability to remotely monitor (and hence access) devices is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving issues without physical presence.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remote is the main reason interventions can be instant and efficient. It could be because remote access and remote monitoring enable technicians and other teams to be available and respond without having to travel or in the middle of the night because they are on the other side of the planet. So, our topic focuses specifically on monitoring from anywhere.</p>

<h3>2. Real-Time System Monitoring - Moment by Moment to Never Miss a Thing!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Server monitoring tools allow continuous monitoring of systems, keeping a vigilant eye on their performance and health. Tools with frequent regular visibility and logging are arguably the only way forwards.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To make real-time surveillance work, notifications and alerts prove essential. Being informed of an overload or downtime or that a threshold has been reached is crucial to reacting in a timely manner. For teams to take the appropriate action on time, it is necessary for them to be aware of the need to act and on what part of the system.</p>

<h3>3. Resources Management:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Efficient infrastructure management seeks to balance, streamline and automate workload and data allocation. This is key in optimising memory usage and enabling efficiency, stability, speed and productivity.</p>

<h3>4. Value for Money - One extra for the road:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pricing should reflect the value and functionality offered by the tools, ensuring a cost-effective solution.</p>

<h2>Four Criteria for the Right Remote Server Monitoring Software</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Selecting the ideal software to monitor your IT infrastructure is a critical decision for IT professionals in any organisation or trade. Like I said, the premise of this article is that it includes remote accessibility, so remote administrators can access endpoints. Beyond that, here are the key criteria to consider:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Integrated Tools:</strong> Look for a package that includes all necessary tools within a single interface, reducing the need to switch between tasks and windows.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Scalability:</strong> The software should accommodate your growth and provide support for multiple clients and networks.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Trial Period:</strong> Opt for software that offers a free trial or a money-back guarantee, allowing you to assess its suitability for your needs without financial risk.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Security:</strong> Prioritise software that emphasises security, as protecting sensitive data is paramount in today's digital landscape.</p>
</li>
</ol>

In today's fast-paced world, work knows no boundaries. Whether you're on the go, at home, or halfway across the globe, the need to access your work computer or critical applications can arise at any moment. Today's question is how to use remote desktop. Interestingly, that's where <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> shines, offering you the ultimate flexibility to work seamlessly from any location. And wonderfully, it is completely scalable, so size is a simple question of organisation and planning.
<h2>Unlocking Freedom: Work on the Move with TSplus Remote Access Desktop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Gone are the days when your work was tethered to a physical office desk. TSplus empowers you to break free of physical location, enabling you to harness the full potential of your IT resources while on the move. In this guide, we will first walk you through the steps of setting up and starting to use TSplus Remote Access.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, this is a new take on a topic I covered some months ago <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-work/blog/how-to-use-remote-desktop/">here</a>. From a Remote Access point of view, there remained more to say. With that in mind, our next step will be to put the emphasis on this software's remarkable capabilities to keep you productive, no matter where you are. Or, to paraphrase: “how to <em>make use of</em> TSplus Remote Access for your desktops” to show off some of its potential.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, let us dive into the world of TSplus and discover how you can maximise your efficiency and work from anywhere with ease.</p>

<h2>How To Use Remote Desktop Functionality? Follow These Steps:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>
<h4>Access TSplus Remote Access:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">First, ensure you have TSplus Remote Access <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/installation/">installed and configured on your system</a>. If you haven't installed it already, you can obtain our software from our website. You can buy directly or use the trial period to test it for free.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>Launch the TSplus Client:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Open the TSplus client application on your computer. This client software allows you to connect to remote desktops and applications.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>Enter Connexion Details:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">You will typically need to enter the following details:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Server Address:</strong> Input the IP address or hostname of the remote server you want to connect to.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Username and Password:</strong> Provide your credentials to authenticate yourself on the remote server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>Select Remote Desktop or Application:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Depending on your requirements, you may choose to connect to a full remote desktop or only specific applications published through TSplus. Also, you may allow or disallow specific users certain actions or accesses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The management console enables administration of authorisations and access in relation to users and groups, amongst other parameters.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>Connect:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Click the "Connect" or "Login" button to establish a remote connexion.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>Remote Desktop Session:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you selected a full remote desktop, you now have access to the remote computer as though you were physically present in front of it. Indeed, you can run applications, access files and perform tasks, just as you would on a local desktop.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>Disconnect:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you're done with your remote session, ensure you log off or disconnect properly to ensure security.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Android Capability- Coming Soon:</strong> While TSplus Remote Support is comprehensive in many aspects and Mac compatibility is currently in beta testing, support for Android devices is listed as "coming soon". TSplus Remote Support will therefore not directly meet the needs of users with Android-based devices.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Dependency on .NET Framework:</strong> The software relies on .NET Framework, which needs to be installed on the target computer. Remember this necessary requirement to ensure compatibility with your systems.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>TSplus Academy - Up and Running in No Time</h2>

In the realm of IT management, knowing how to enable RDP Remote Registry on Windows 10 and 11 can prove highly valuable. This feature allows IT professionals and administrators to efficiently manage registry settings on remote systems. In this article, you can read up on what Registry is, its significance and its purpose, what it being accessible remotely implies and the security considerations involved. If you still want to go ahead, now is the time to test <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">TSplus Advanced Security</a> to make sure you system risks nothing from outside while you work on this. Finally, before wrapping up, you will find the necessary steps to activate Remote Registry and RDP.
<h2>What is the Windows Registry?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In Windows, the Registry is a database of configuration settings and options, stored hierarchically. These are applicable to the Windows operating system, but also to the hardware and to installed software. Therefore, the Registry is crucial for Windows and to its applications functioning correctly. This makes it all the more important that it be only accessible by persons who are both authorised and well versed in what to modify (or not) and how.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Block Malicious IP Addresses:</strong> Keep your system protected by automatically blocking recognised threats, bolstering your defences against cyberattacks.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Community-Powered Security:</strong> Hacker IP Protection relies on the vigilance of the Advanced Security user community to ensure that all blacklisted IPs are genuine threats, minimising false positives.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Automated Updates:</strong> The feature updates daily, providing you with real-time protection against emerging threats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understanding the Role of the Windows Registry</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, the Windows registry serves as a centralized database housing critical configuration settings for the operating system, hardware and software. Consequently, this database plays a pivotal role in maintaining system functionality. Within the Registry, IT administrators can remotely access and modify registry entries on target systems. For example, the Remote Registry service is essential for running certain tools which would be disabled in the event of a faulty modification.</p>

<h2>The Importance of "Remote" for the Registry and IT Pros Everywhere</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As we now know, the Registry service is vital to the Windows OS. But it is also an asset for IT experts, especially the fact it is Remote. When an authorised user is able to access the registry remotely for particular tasks rather than need to attend to the machine in person, it either simplifies certain tasks or just making them possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It grants the capability to remotely control and modify registry settings on remote Windows servers and client computers. This capability is key in implementing fixes and carrying out maintenance. Additionally, it streamlines administrative tasks such as configuration management and software deployment. What more do you need for enabling RDP Remote Registry to be a must-know for IT professionals.</p>

<h2>Measured Actions when Remoting into Windows 10 or 11 Registry</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">To enable RDP Remote Registry on Windows 10 and 11, you must navigate through specific steps. It is important to note that this feature is disabled by default for security reasons. Therefore, enabling it requires careful consideration and adherence to best practice.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Permission to access the Remote Registry Service:</strong> To initiate the process, ensure you have the necessary permissions to modify registry settings on the target system. Essentially you will need your administrator credentials for both machines, including the hostname of the remote PC.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Default Access:</strong> By default, only members of the groups “administrators” and “backup operators” have access to the registry remotely. This restricts unauthorized access. <a href="https://docs.terminalserviceplus.com/advanced-security/permissions">TSplus</a> adds extra protection to these restrictions.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Administrator Rights:</strong> Remember that reserving certain actions to administrators is never an empty process. Modifications to the Windows registry should not bedone lightly since they can break the system. At one point or another of any of the following paths to Remote Registry, there will be a question of administrator rights, passwords etc.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Know-how:</strong> Before you begin, ensure you know what you are about to do, why, how to go about it safely for the system, etc. It seems sensible to back up first too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Security Considerations with Remote Registry on Windows</h2>
While RDP Remote Registry offers valuable administrative capabilities, as described, it poses potential security concerns. That is why it is available but inactive by default. For this additional reason, it is often recommended to disable network access to the registry, especially in high-security environments. Unauthorized changes to the registry are indeed likely to disrupt system operations. Hence why it is essential to weigh the benefits against the risk when going about activation and any changes. It is also paramount to monitor such services so you can pick up at the earliest possible stage any untoward Registry activity.
<h2>Securing Devices with TSplus Advanced Security in the Remote Registry Context</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Advanced Security provides essential security for your devices in this context. Indeed, enabling remote access is a necessity for efficient system management and preventing external attacks while you work in remote registry is paramount. However, remotely intervening in Windows registry simultaneously increases the exposure to external tampering. This potential security risk is where <a href="https://tsplus.net/pricing/">TSplus Advanced Security steps in</a>, without breaking the bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By leveraging the capabilities of TSplus Advanced Security, IT professionals can implement a multi-layered defense strategy that mitigates the risk of external attacks. Our advanced security solution employs various mechanisms to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of critical system data, such as the Windows registry.</p>

<h2>Activation and Configuration of RDP and Remote Registry – Windows 10 or 11</h2>
<h3>Option 1, Registry Editor:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">If Windows registry services and RDP are enabled, you can remote in and perform these actions via remote access.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Windows 11 and 10 have a preinstalled registry editor which you can find as you normally would on a PC. You might reach the tool:</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">using the <strong>Search</strong>;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">browsing from the <strong>control panel</strong> (It should be accessible from the Windows tool under System and Security.);</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">and alternately you can use <strong>Run </strong>(Simultaneously press the Windows key and R then enter regedit and validate.);</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Windows Terminal</strong> or</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">the <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are more paths to follow including creating a hotkey or shortcut. These last two make it a little too easy in my mind, unless this really is an action you need to carry out very frequently.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you are in the Registry Editor tool, you can carry out the needed verifications or modifications.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>NB:</strong> It is worth noting that certain changes that you implement directly into the registry will not configure related actions or apps which would be modified by a “standard” set-up of the item. Think of it as a domino trail: certain actions push more than one button but working up the trail will not press those downstream, just as the domino will not knock over those in its back.</p>

<h3>Option 2, Command Lines for Enabling RDP Remote Registry access - Windows 10 and 11:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, it is possible to use command lines to implement a series of changes, step by step, to activate RDP directly from the registry. Therefore, you can choose to do the background work there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One thing to remember, is how this may trigger anti-virus reactions. Indeed, PsExec is the tool you need for this option, but... Since it has often been used by malware, it will likely cause your guards to raise their shield at you. And, if you are not a programmer at heart, with precision down to the hilt, then beware that dash you forgot and the consequences it may have.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That said, PsExec has its uses since it makes the impossible possible: activating a de-activated protocol, from afar.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To begin with, these steps imply you working within your LAN. You need to log into the registry of the remote computer, therefore have admin rights to both devices you are using.</p>

<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here, your first action will be disabling the firewall, preferably only on the ports used by RDP.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next action will be to enable Remote Desktop. For that, you can continue using PsExec or move on to opening the Registry Editor. Either way, you need to change the DenyTS connections command value from 1 to 0.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now RDP is enabled, you can proceed to launch RDS and use your admin credentials to connect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Option 3, Enabling RDP Remote Registry access - Windows 10 and 11 with PowerShell:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is also possible to go down the PowerShell route. For today, I will leave it to your favourite research engine for the information and steps for this option. Nevertheless, I wanted to include it to complete the range of choices.</p>

<h2>Key TSplus Security Features for Windows Remote Registry</h2>

Once we have answered "what is a virtual desktop?" in short, we can broach the differences between virtual and remote desktops then go on to inspect their main advantages and disadvantages. Thus we can better grasp their potential uses and the benefits one or the other can bring in a given situation. Read on for a comparison between Virtual Desktop Infrastructure and what we at <a href="https://tsplus.net/">TSplus</a> make possible via Remote Desktop Protocol.
<h2>What is a Virtual Desktop?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">A virtual desktop, also known as a virtualised desktop or VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure), is a technology that allows users to access and interact with a desktop operating system and applications on a remote server, typically over a network connection. Instead of running the operating system and applications on their local computer, users connect to a virtual desktop hosted on a centralised server or cloud infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Alternative Technology to Virtual Desktops</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another way of making a desktop available remotely is RDP. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) are both technologies that enable remote access to desktop environments, but they differ in their architecture and primary use cases. As RDP is primarily used by Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS), this part is going to generalise to RDS. Below are the key differences between VDI and RDS.</p>

<h2>Characteristics and Uses of a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI):</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Desktop Isolation:</strong> In VDI, each user typically has their own dedicated virtual desktop machine. This means that users have full control over their desktop environment. Also, changes or installations a user makes neither affects the infrastructure nor impacts other users.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Operating System:</strong> VDI often provides a full desktop operating system, such as Windows, for each user. This allows for a more personalized and customized user experience.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Resource Intensive:</strong> VDI can be more resource-intensive because it can require separate virtual machines for each user. As a result, it may call for a more significant investment in hardware, staff involvement and the like.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Persistent or non-persistent:</strong> User desktops can be persistent or nonpersistent. This means users will either log into their own reserved virtual desktop each time or that all users log in and out of generic desktops which are therefore less customised and on which no personal data is kept once logoff is complete. The first option takes up more space and maintenance while the second is lighter on storage.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Uses:</strong> VDI is suitable for scenarios where users need a highly personalised desktop experience, require access to specific applications and where security and isolation are critical. <strong>Some examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Industries with strict security and compliance requirements, such as healthcare, finance, or government.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Requirements for personalized and customized desktop environments where employees need full control over their desktop settings and software installations.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Software developers and testers who need to work with different development environments, configurations and tools in isolated environments without impacting their local machines.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Organisations with a distributed or remote workforce, so employees access their personalised desktop environments from various locations and devices while maintaining a consistent user experience.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Resource-intensive applications such as 3D rendering, CAD design or data analysis where dedicated computing power is essential.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Characteristics and Uses of Remote Desktop Services (RDS):</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Session-Based:</strong> RDS, on the other hand, uses a session-based approach which uses less processing while in use. Multiple users share a single instance of an operating system and its applications. Each user has their own session, but they are essentially sharing the same underlying OS and resources.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Resource Efficient:</strong> RDS is typically more resource-efficient than VDI because users share resources. This can lead to cost savings in terms of hardware and management.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Application-Centric:</strong> RDS puts the emphasis on application publication and remote use. Users can access applications from their remote session without needing a full desktop environment.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Adapted to Non-Standardised Infrastructures:</strong> RDS, due to the fact that it enables both desktop access and application publication, offers the freedom to do either or both in varying combinations depending on fluctuating and diverse users and needs.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Uses:</strong> RDS is often used when the primary goal is to deliver specific applications to users. This means users can be given access to a desktop or a single application or anything in between, according to requirements, including a specific set of applications. Importantly, RDP can also be suited for perpetuation of legacy applications, as per our TSplus Remote Access capability. We are proud to say <a href="https://tsplus.net/references/">many businesses and industries trust us. </a><strong>Examples of TSplus Remote Access in use:</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Industries using specific applications requiring powerful devices to run yet which benefit from employee mobility and thus need at least part of their device park to consist of lighter, smaller machines, such as tablets or smartphones.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Companies with budget constraints looking to maximize efficient use of resources by deploying software throughout their network, prolonging the life of hardware or software through the implementation of TSplus Remote Access.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Professionals delivering specific applications or tailored desktops to users whether providing software as a service (SaaS) or deploying specialised applications network-wide.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Organisations with a large number of users who can do without individualised desktops but instead require access to a common set of applications.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Settings where individual users need distant access to their usual devices from within or without the company network.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Smaller organisations or those without extensive IT expertise since TSplus Remote Access is both easier to set up and to manage.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Organisations that anticipate growth in the number of remote users. TSplus Remote Access enables companies to scale user access without significant increases in hardware or software resources.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Desktops supporting remote and hybrid work where data privacy and security are paramount and compliance has to be verified.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>In Summary, How do RDS and VDI Compare?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The choice between VDI and RDS depends on the specific requirements and use cases of the organisation. VDI is generally more suitable for personalised desktop environments and high security requirements, while RDS is a more resource-efficient choice especially when the focus is on delivering applications to users. For RDS to be as secure as a VDI solution, it must either be used as part of an enclosed in-house infrastructure or given other security and safeguards. Or you could turn to a third option.</p>

<h2>How About RDP Without the Worry</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our company, TSplus, has developed an alternative to Citrix and RDS, in so far as it offers solutions related to VDI and RDS. In practice, our Remote Access provides both remote access and application publishing. Indeed, <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/">TSplus Remote Access</a> leverages RDP amongst other remote technologies yet is fully secure and encrypted thanks to its build and structure. So, you have all the advantages of RDP with as much security as VDI, especially if you activate the 2FA. And if you add our Advanced Security software, you can sleep soundly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">TSplus Remote Access is thus perfectly tailored to the needs of IT professionals who wish to efficiently use their IT infrastructure and can even be accessed purely via any web browser over HTML5 which makes its use entirely OS-independent. TSplus Remote Access enables full usage of your hardware and software, while enhancing and maximising its potential.</p>

<h2>What You Gain VS What You Lose: Pros and Cons</h2>
<h3>Pros and Cons of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI):</h3>
<h5>Advantages:</h5>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Independent Desktops:</em> VDI provides users with personal dedicated virtual desktops, ensuring complete isolation of usage and data. This naturally enhances security and privacy, making it adapted for industries with strict compliance requirements.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Personalisation:</em> Users can fully personalise their virtual desktop environments, installing applications and customising settings as needed. This flexibility is beneficial for individuals who require a tailored desktop experience.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Application Compatibility:</em> VDI comes into its own in situations where users indifferently need access to a variety of software. It often supports a wide range of applications, as it provides a full desktop operating system.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Security:</em> With dedicated virtual desktops, the risk of data leakage or cross-contamination between users is minimised, contributing to improved security.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Persistent and Non-persistent:</em> this distinction aligns with the flexibility needed for different user requirements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Intensive in Resources:</em> VDI can be more resource-intensive since it requires separate virtual machines for each user. This can rapidly lead to higher hardware and management costs. The upkeep of such an infrastructure will also lead to increased administrative and maintenance hours.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Complex:</em> Implementing and managing VDI can be more complex compared to RDS, requiring expertise in virtualisation and infrastructure management.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Potential Compatibility Issues:</em> Though it provides great compatibility, this may nevertheless hit a wall if the virtual OS of a particular desktop does not support specific applications.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Cost:</em> The initial setup and ongoing maintenance costs of VDI can be higher, which may not be suitable for organisations with budget constraints.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Pros and Cons of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with TSplus Remote Access:</h3>
<h5>Advantages:</h5>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Legacy Application Publishing:</em> Web-enabling applications saves industries and businesses the trouble of renewing their software for less adapted alternatives, with the accompanying learning curve. TSplus also frees companies to lengthen the life-span of their hardware and IT parks and reduce spending while chipping in protecting the environment.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Resource-Efficient:</em> With TSplus Remote Access, RDP is very efficient in resources because multiple users share a single operating system and its resources. This centralisation is also present in the memory and processing usage which all happens in the remote servers. This leads to savings not only in terms of hardware, software and management resources, but also in terms of cost and time.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Simplified Management:</em> RDP is native therefore easier to set up and manage. This makes it a more straightforward choice for organisations without extensive IT resources. With TSplus Remote Access, the options do not stop at standard RDP. As well as the classic Remote Desktop Connection (MSTSC.EXE), you can also use the <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-access/installation/#choose-how-users-will-connect">portable TSplus RDP client</a>, the TSplus Seamless client MS RemoteAPP client, or even either the HTML5 or the Windows client over the TSplus Web Portal.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Application-Centric:</em> RDP is well-suited for delivering specific applications to users. TSplus puts it to use in an efficient way. Hence, you can provide your users with access to a set of applications without the need for a full desktop environment.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Value-for-money: </em> The initial setup and ongoing maintenance costs of VDI can be higher, which may not be suitable for organisations with budget constraints.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Scalability:</em> RDP is scalable and can accommodate a growing number of users without significant increases in resource requirements. As devices can be light and need less processing power, the cost of scaling up is reduced too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5>Disadvantages - Not Any More:</h5>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Limited Personalisation:</em> typically, RDP users have limited control over the desktop environment since they share the same operating system. Though most customisations can be set in a few moments, this may not be suitable for users who require extensive customisation. On the other hand, with TSplus, remote technology enables users to access their own devices from anywhere, reopening the door to personalised spaces.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Security Concerns:</em> These are wiped out since, thanks to TSplus Remote Access, RDP can be secured. All the more with our Enterprise bundle which includes <a href="https://tsplus.net/advanced-security/">Advanced Security</a>. With no data actually leaving the safety of the server and appropriate encryption, requirements are met or even exceeded. 2FA is available and Advanced Security provides all-round cyber-security and more to boot. The result is a shared environment has nothing to envy from VDI's isolated desktops.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Application Compatibility:</em> RDS may have limitations when it comes to supporting certain applications. This may especially apply to those requiring a dedicated desktop environment or those incompatible with the Microsoft OS. TSplus though, frees IT, remote desktops and RDP from compatibility constraints by simply making everything securely available over HTML5.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion on What is a Virtual Desktop</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In summary, VDI is well-suited to situations where security, personalisation and individual desktop isolation are crucial. Meanwhile, RDS is advantageous for organisations looking for a cost-effective, resource-efficient solution that focusing on application delivery and simplified management. On the other hand, it remains less secure. Certainly, any choice depends on the specific use cases, needs, budget and goals of an organisation. Choosing between VDI and RDS is no different.</p>

This means users can be given access to a desktop or a single application or anything in between, according to requirements, including a specific set of applications. Importantly, RDP can also be suited for perpetuation of legacy applications, as per our TSplus Remote Access capability. We are proud to say <a href=\"https:\/\/tsplus.net\/references\/\">many businesses and industries trust us. <\/a><strong>Examples of TSplus Remote Access in use:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Industries using specific applications requiring powerful devices to run yet which benefit from employee mobility and thus need at least part of their device park to consist of lighter, smaller machines, such as tablets or smartphones.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Companies with budget constraints looking to maximize efficient use of resources by deploying software throughout their network, prolonging the life of hardware or software through the implementation of TSplus Remote Access.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Professionals delivering specific applications or tailored desktops to users whether providing software as a service (SaaS) or deploying specialised applications network-wide.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Organisations with a large number of users who can do without individualised desktops but instead require access to a common set of applications.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Settings where individual users need distant access to their usual devices from within or without the company network.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Smaller organisations or those without extensive IT expertise since TSplus Remote Access is both easier to set up and to manage.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Organisations that anticipate growth in the number of remote users.

The IT sector is in constant growth and more than ever opens a myriad possibilities. With such potential at so many people’s finger-tips, it is no wonder that support is such a central necessity for any business, organisation or even household. The number of actions now feasible via a computer device and over the Internet is quite simply incredible. No wonder so many have trouble keeping pace.For a while now, the development team have been working on opening a new horizon for the Remote Support customers among you. They focused on a TSplus solution to "how to RDP from Mac to PC for remote support". Indeed, many companies use Windows day-in, day-out. Yet even amongst users who are essentially Microsoft-based, your companies generally have at least one, and sometimes more, Mac devices for specific teams or a variety of specialized uses.Up until now, these machines were outside of our support software’s reach. And once they got their heads together, well, forget RDP, and simply provide remote control and support from Mac to PC using <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/">TSplus Remote Support</a>.
<h2>Brainstorming, Developing and Growing the TSplus Way</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The TSplus teams work closely together to make our products and solutions as simple, useful, affordable and, most importantly, secure. Regional managers, resellers and customers themselves provide valuable insight into customer and user needs and requirements, whether they specialize in sales or the support.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This user-centric approach allows our team of developers to craft features that align perfectly with the unique requirements of our clients. This improves our products in the most interesting directions possible, furnishing our clients with more pertinent solutions.</p>

<h2>Developing the Brand New Mac OS Compatibility for TSplus Remote Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have known for a while that potential TSplus users stuck with more expensive alternatives or kept on using them in parallel of our software, biding their time for this pending bridge between OSs. This seemed a pity, so a great deal of team hours has gone into this new string to our bow. There is no longer any need to be hampered in the breadth of your cross-platform interventions: you can download the most recent version of TSplus Remote Support now and <a href="https://tsplus.net/remote-support/installation/#basics">get the Mac client directly from our online quick-start guide</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We aim for our users to be enabled to provide a more complete service thanks to this new capacity of the product. Indeed, the Mac capability works in both directions and from Mac to Mac. What a way to unleash Windows support provision from a Mac device and vice-versa while also opening new horizons.</p>

<h4>Mac to Windows, Windows to Mac, Mac to Mac, and So On - No Extra Fee</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">And what’s more, the feature is included in the software tool as standard. Unlike with other providers, no need for you to pay extra for this Mac compatibility. To get your hands into this brand new feature, download TSplus Remote Support now to try or buy it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyhow, here are the main steps for setting up remote connections without and with our software, so you can compare.</p>

<h2>Set Up and Enable RDP Between a Mac and a Windows PC</h2>
<h3>Connecting to Windows PCs from a Mac with RDP:</h3>
<h4>1.	Enable Remote Connections on your Windows PC:</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Open the System Properties on your Windows PC.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Click on the "Remote" tab.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ensure that the "Allow remote connections to this computer" option is enabled.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ensure you have the appropriate cyber-security protection since RDP is otherwise vulnerable when facing the Web.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2.	Install and Configure Microsoft Remote Desktop Client on your Mac device:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Visit the App Store on your Mac.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Search for and install the "Microsoft Remote Desktop" client.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Launch the Remote Desktop client on your Mac.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Create a user profile, which is ready for use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.	Configure the Connection:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Next to "Connection name," provide a “friendly name” (or nickname) for the connection.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">For "PC name," enter either the name you've given to your target PC or its IP address.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">No need to configure a gateway if you're connecting to your PC within the local network.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can add your user-name and password to the "Credentials" if you want to avoid entering them each time you connect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Connecting to Mac from Windows:</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">To connect from a Windows PC to a Mac, first you need a Mac connection client, which can be downloaded from the App Store.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is worth noting that Mac systems use VNC for their remote desktop connections. Therefore, the main recommendation is to also use a VNC client on your PC.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">This client could be why so many of our competitors provide Mac compatibility as extra, only in higher packages, etc.. So, do read on and find out how TSplus Remote Support can simplify your IT support as well as lighten your IT budget.</p>

<h2>A Word on Mac to PC and cost of subscription</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Indeed, the Mac capability is available from TeamViewer and certain other providers, but often for an extra fee. Many also only include it in more complete and expensive packages. You may consider TeamViewer an option, or any other provider (these also may involve a subscription). Otherwise, TSplus Remote Support simply includes its <a href="https://tsplus.net/pricing/remote-support/">Mac to and from PC intervention feature</a> in all its packages. Moreover, the TSplus Mac client is all you need for all these connections, even Mac to Mac. We think this is great value for money.</p>

<h2>Important Security Reminder for RDP</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Are you trying to connect to the Windows PC from outside of your local network? If so, setting up a port forwarding or port redirection rule of ports 3389, 80, 443 is important. Which depends on your preferred connection method. You can modify RDP ports in the Home tab.</p>

<h2>Set up Remote Control between Mac and PC with TSplus Remote Support, no RDP?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">With TSplus Remote Support, there is no more need for RDP and little or nothing to set up, even with mac. Indeed, the connection clients, as executables or DMGs, will enable you either to take control of a Remote Support session as an "agent" or to share sessions as an end-user.</p>

<h4>1. Download the TSplus Remote Support client:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">On your PC, download the TSplus Remote Support agent or end-user EXE file.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">On your Mac, download and run the Remote Support DMG. Like our Windows client, our Mac client is available directly from our website so you need not search any further for it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Launch our Mac client on your device:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Double click the headset icon to launch our connection client.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Validate the connection on your PC or Mac:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Register if this is your first time, or simply log in.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Accept the connection with the credentials the end-user shares with you or request to share your screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Get to work!</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, your Mac and Windows PC are connected all that is left is to do your job. With everything set up correctly, you should now be able to control either device from either OS with TSplus fluidity, rapidity and security.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Cyber news is made of stories each more frightening and worrisome than the previous, a fitting theme for the end of October. Citrix Bleed is no exception. After a previous vulnerability and patching in early summer, Citrix has been making headlines most of this autumn with news of inroads into large corporate and governmental networks. Here is how Citrix Bleed vulnerability CVE-2023-4966 is causing sleepless nights in some spheres, ensuing recommendations and our very own solutions and protection to guard your remote infrastructure against such dangers. The news is not all bad.
<h2>Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway Under Fire</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Citrix Bleed, a critical information-disclosure bug affecting NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway, has been under "mass exploitation," with thousands of vulnerable Citrix servers still online in spite of the release of a patch on October 10. Since then, regular waves of news have reminded us that the vulnerability is still allowing attackers to access the memory of exposed devices. There, attacks extract session tokens for unauthorized access, even once the patch has been applied.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ransomware gangs have been exploiting this vulnerability and Mandiant is tracking multiple groups targeting various sectors globally. The US government has classified it as an unknown exploited vulnerability. Google-owned Mandiant emphasizes the need to terminate all active sessions for effective mitigation. The bug has been exploited since late August, with criminals using it for cyber espionage. Financial threat actors have been expected to exploit, so it is all the more important to stop Citrix Bleed before it is too late.</p>

<h2>CVE-2023-4966 Vulnerability Ongoing in Spite of Patching</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It appears that, as of October 30, had left over 5,000 vulnerable servers exposed on the public internet. GreyNoise observed 137 individual IP addresses attempting to exploit this Citrix vulnerability within the past week. Despite Citrix's prompt disclosure and issuance of a patch (CVE-2023-4966) on October 10, the situation escalated rapidly. Even after applying the patch, session tokens persisted, leaving systems vulnerable to exploitation. The gravity of the situation is underscored by the fact that, as feared, ransomware crews have jumped on the opportunity to exploit this vulnerability, distributing python scripts to automate the attack chain.</p>

<h2>Strategically Thought-out Tools and Steps for the Attacks</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">These attacks have donned a multifaceted nature as they progressed beyond the initial exploitation. The attackers seemed initially engaged in network reconnaissance. Yet, goals have obviously extended to the theft of critical account credentials and shown lateral movement through the compromised networks. In this phase, they employed a diverse set of tools, demonstrating a well-orchestrated approach to their malicious activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Those behind these campaigns have demonstrated a high level of sophistication in their approach, employing a wide array of tools and techniques to achieve their goals. Attackers used specially crafted HTTP GET requests to force the Citrix appliance to reveal system memory contents, including valid Netscaler AAA session cookies. This has been allowing them to bypass multifactor authentication, making their intrusion even more insidious.</p>

<h2>Look Out for the Specific Tool Combination</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">One notable tool in their arsenal is FREEFIRE, a novel lightweight .NET backdoor using Slack for command and control. This is the sole unusual tool in the arsenal. Attacks leveraged many standard and native processes, with the addition the run of the mill remote desktop access and management tools Atera, AnyDesk and SplashTop. This goes to show how hard hackers have worked to remain invisible to detection. Indeed, whereas individually, these tools are generally found in legitimate enterprise environments, only their combined deployment by the threat actors serves as a significant red flag. Unless your security software and team are looking out for this combination indicative of a compromise, it would pass unnoticed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here is the list of tools the hackers have been using to retrieve session information and move horizontally through networks (as well as their purposes as described by Bleeping Computer):</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>net.exe</strong> – Active Directory (AD) reconnaissance;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>netscan.exe</strong> – internal network enumeration;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>7-zip</strong> – create an encrypted segmented archive for compressing reconnaissance data;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>certutil</strong> – encode (base64) and decode data files and deploy backdoors;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>e.exe and d.dll</strong> – load into the LSASS process memory and create memory dump files;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>sh3.exe</strong> – run the Mimikatz LSADUMP command for credential extraction;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FREEFIRE </strong>– novel lightweight .NET backdoor using Slack for command and control;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Atera </strong>– Remote monitoring and management;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>AnyDesk </strong>– Remote desktop;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SplashTop </strong>– Remote desktop.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you probably agree, nothing much untoward unless you find them all being combined. Except for one, that is: FREEFIRE.</p>

<h2>FREEFIRE in Particular Used by Hackers in Citrix Bleed</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is worth noting that while some of these tools are commonly found in enterprise environments, their combined usage in these campaigns is a strong indicator of a breach. Mandiant has even released a Yara rule employed to detect the presence of FREEFIRE on a device. This tool is particularly valuable in helping organizations proactively identify compromised systems and take swift action to mitigate the risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Below, you can find the Yara rule for detecting FREEFIRE. Still, should you wish to verify the Yara rule there or to read the MITRE ATT&CK techniques, these close the Mandiant article. There, you can also find their link to Mandiant’s “Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway: CVE-2023-4966 Remediation” guide in PDF.</p>
